      <b>DEDICATION</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR, KENSINGTON, <i>May, 1864.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Allow me, with the honour due to my father&rsquo;s friend, to inscribe this
      little volume with your name. The name of one friend is better than those
      of all the Muses.
    </p>
    <p>
      And permit me to say a few words about the story.&mdash;It is a Romance. I
      am well aware that, with many readers, this epithet will be enough to
      ensure condemnation. But there ought to be a place for any story, which,
      although founded in the marvellous, is true to human nature and to itself.
      Truth to Humanity, and harmony within itself, are almost the sole
      unvarying essentials of a work of art. Even <i>The Rime of the Ancient
      Mariner</i>&mdash;than which what more marvellous?&mdash;is true in these
      respects. And Shakespere himself will allow any amount of the marvellous,
      provided this truth is observed. I hope my story is thus true; and
      therefore, while it claims some place, undeserving of being classed with
      what are commonly called <i>sensational novels.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am well aware that such tales are not of much account, at present; and
      greatly would I regret that they should ever become the fashion; of which,
      however, there is no danger. But, seeing so much of our life must be spent
      in dreaming, may there not be a still nook, shadowy, but not miasmatic, in
      some lowly region of literature, where, in the pauses of labour, a man may
      sit down, and dream such a day-dream as I now offer to your acceptance,
      and that of those who will judge the work, in part at least, by its purely
      literary claims? If I confined my pen to such results, you, at least,
      would have a right to blame me. But you, for one, will, I am sure, justify
      an author in dreaming <i>sometimes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In offering you a story, however, founded on <i>The Second Sight</i>, the
      belief in which was common to our ancestors, I owe you, at the same time,
      an apology. For the tone and colour of the story are so different from
      those naturally belonging to a Celtic tale, that you might well be
      inclined to refuse my request, simply on the ground that your pure
      Highland blood revolted from the degenerate embodiment given to the
      ancient belief. I can only say that my early education was not Celtic
      enough to enable me to do better in this respect. I beg that you will
      accept the offering with forgiveness, if you cannot with approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours affectionately,
    </p>
    <p>
      GEORGE MACDONALD.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. <i>My Boyhood.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      My father belonged to the widespread family of the Campbells, and
      possessed a small landed property in the north of Argyll. But although of
      long descent and high connection, he was no richer than many a farmer of a
      few hundred acres. For, with the exception of a narrow belt of arable land
      at its foot, a bare hill formed almost the whole of his possessions. The
      sheep ate over it, and no doubt found it good; I bounded and climbed all
      over it, and thought it a kingdom. From my very childhood, I had rejoiced
      in being alone. The sense of room about me had been one of my greatest
      delights. Hence, when my thoughts go back to those old years, it is not
      the house, nor the family room, nor that in which I slept, that first of
      all rises before my inward vision, but that desolate hill, the top of
      which was only a wide expanse of moorland, rugged with height and hollow,
      and dangerous with deep, dark pools, but in many portions purple with
      large-belled heather, and crowded with cranberry and blaeberry plants.
      Most of all, I loved it in the still autumn morning, outstretched in
      stillness, high uplifted towards the heaven. On every stalk hung the dew
      in tiny drops, which, while the rising sun was low, sparkled and burned
      with the hues of all the gems. Here and there a bird gave a cry; no other
      sound awoke the silence. I never see the statue of the Roman youth,
      praying with outstretched arms, and open, empty, level palms, as waiting
      to receive and hold the blessing of the gods, but that outstretched barren
      heath rises before me, as if it meant the same thing as the statue&mdash;or
      were, at least, the fit room in the middle space of which to set the
      praying and expectant youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one spot upon the hill, half-way between the valley and the
      moorland, which was my favourite haunt. This part of the hill was covered
      with great blocks of stone, of all shapes and sizes&mdash;here crowded
      together, like the slain where the battle had been fiercest; there parting
      asunder from spaces of delicate green&mdash;of softest grass. In the
      centre of one of these green spots, on a steep part of the hill, were
      three huge rocks&mdash;two projecting out of the hill, rather than
      standing up from it, and one, likewise projecting from the hill, but lying
      across the tops of the two, so as to form a little cave, the back of which
      was the side of the hill. This was my refuge, my home within a home, my
      study&mdash;and, in the hot noons, often my sleeping chamber, and my house
      of dreams. If the wind blew cold on the hillside, a hollow of lulling
      warmth was there, scooped as it were out of the body of the blast, which,
      sweeping around, whistled keen and thin through the cracks and crannies of
      the rocky chaos that lay all about; in which confusion of rocks the wind
      plunged, and flowed, and eddied, and withdrew, as the sea-waves on the
      cliffy shores or the unknown rugged bottoms. Here I would often lie, as
      the sun went down, and watch the silent growth of another sea, which the
      stormy ocean of the wind could not disturb&mdash;the sea of the darkness.
      First it would begin to gather in the bottom of hollow places. Deep
      valleys, and all little pits on the hill-sides, were well-springs where it
      gathered, and whence it seemed to overflow, till it had buried the earth
      beneath its mass, and, rising high into the heavens, swept over the faces
      of the stars, washed the blinding day from them, and let them shine, down
      through the waters of the dark, to the eyes of men below. I would lie till
      nothing but the stars and the dim outlines of hills against the sky was to
      be seen, and then rise and go home, as sure of my path as if I had been
      descending a dark staircase in my father&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the opposite side the valley, another hill lay parallel to mine; and
      behind it, at some miles&rsquo; distance, a great mountain. As often as, in my
      hermit&rsquo;s cave, I lifted my eyes from the volume I was reading, I saw this
      mountain before me. Very different was its character from that of the hill
      on which I was seated. It was a mighty thing, a chieftain of the race,
      seamed and scarred, featured with chasms and precipices and over-leaning
      rocks, themselves huge as hills; here blackened with shade, there
      overspread with glory; interlaced with the silvery lines of falling
      streams, which, hurrying from heaven to earth, cared not how they went, so
      it were downwards. Fearful stories were told of the gulfs, sullen waters,
      and dizzy heights upon that terror-haunted mountain. In storms the wind
      roared like thunder in its caverns and along the jagged sides of its
      cliffs, but at other times that uplifted land-uplifted, yet secret and
      full of dismay&mdash;lay silent as a cloud on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a certain peculiarity of constitution, which I have some reason to
      believe I inherit. It seems to have its root in an unusual delicacy of
      hearing, which often conveys to me sounds inaudible to those about me.
      This I have had many opportunities of proving. It has likewise, however,
      brought me sounds which I could never trace back to their origin; though
      they may have arisen from some natural operation which I had not
      perseverance or mental acuteness sufficient to discover. From this, or, it
      may be, from some deeper cause with which this is connected, arose a
      certain kind of fearfulness associated with the sense of hearing, of which
      I have never heard a corresponding instance. Full as my mind was of the
      wild and sometimes fearful tales of a Highland nursery, fear never entered
      my mind by the eyes, nor, when I brooded over tales of terror, and fancied
      new and yet more frightful embodiments of horror, did I shudder at any
      imaginable spectacle, or tremble lest the fancy should become fact, and
      from behind the whin-bush or the elder-hedge should glide forth the tall
      swaying form of the Boneless. When alone in bed, I used to lie awake, and
      look out into the room, peopling it with the forms of all the persons who
      had died within the scope of my memory and acquaintance. These fancied
      forms were vividly present to my imagination. I pictured them pale, with
      dark circles around their hollow eyes, visible by a light which glimmered
      within them; not the light of life, but a pale, greenish phosphorescence,
      generated by the decay of the brain inside. Their garments were white and
      trailing, but torn and soiled, as by trying often in vain to get up out of
      the buried coffin. But so far from being terrified by these imaginings, I
      used to delight in them; and in the long winter evenings, when I did not
      happen to have any book that interested me sufficiently, I used even to
      look forward with expectation to the hour when, laying myself straight
      upon my back, as if my bed were my coffin, I could call up from
      underground all who had passed away, and see how they fared, yea, what
      progress they had made towards final dissolution of form&mdash;but all the
      time, with my fingers pushed hard into my ears, lest the faintest sound
      should invade the silent citadel of my soul. If inadvertently I removed
      one of my fingers, the agony of terror I instantly experienced is
      indescribable. I can compare it to nothing but the rushing in upon my
      brain of a whole churchyard of spectres. The very possibility of hearing a
      sound, in such a mood, and at such a time, was almost enough to paralyse
      me. So I could scare myself in broad daylight, on the open hillside, by
      imagining unintelligible sounds; and my imagination was both original and
      fertile in the invention of such. But my mind was too active to be often
      subjected to such influences. Indeed life would have been hardly endurable
      had these moods been of more than occasional occurrence. As I grew older,
      I almost outgrew them. Yet sometimes one awful dread would seize me&mdash;that,
      perhaps, the prophetic power manifest in the gift of second sight, which,
      according to the testimony of my old nurse, had belonged to several of my
      ancestors, had been in my case transformed in kind without losing its
      nature, transferring its abode from the sight to the hearing, whence
      resulted its keenness, and my fear and suffering.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. <i>The Second Hearing</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One summer evening, I had lingered longer than usual in my rocky retreat:
      I had lain half dreaming in the mouth of my cave, till the shadows of
      evening had fallen, and the gloaming had deepened half-way towards the
      night. But the night had no more terrors for me than the day. Indeed, in
      such regions there is a solitariness for which there seems a peculiar
      sense, and upon which the shadows of night sink with a strange relief,
      hiding from the eye the wide space which yet they throw more open to the
      imagination. When I lifted my head, only a star here and there caught my
      eye; but, looking intently into the depths of blue-grey, I saw that they
      were crowded with twinkles. The mountain rose before me, a huge mass of
      gloom; but its several peaks stood out against the sky with a clear, pure,
      sharp outline, and looked nearer to me than the bulk from which they rose
      heaven-wards. One star trembled and throbbed upon the very tip of the
      loftiest, the central peak, which seemed the spire of a mighty temple
      where the light was worshipped&mdash;crowned, therefore, in the darkness,
      with the emblem of the day. I was lying, as I have said, with this fancy
      still in my thought, when suddenly I heard, clear, though faint and far
      away, the sound as of the iron-shod hoofs of a horse, in furious gallop
      along an uneven rocky surface. It was more like a distant echo than an
      original sound. It seemed to come from the face of the mountain, where no
      horse, I knew, could go at that speed, even if its rider courted certain
      destruction. There was a peculiarity, too, in the sound&mdash;a certain
      tinkle, or clank, which I fancied myself able, by auricular analysis, to
      distinguish from the body of the sound. Supposing the sound to be caused
      by the feet of a horse, the peculiarity was just such as would result from
      one of the shoes being loose. A terror&mdash;strange even to my experience&mdash;seized
      me, and I hastened home. The sounds gradually died away as I descended the
      hill. Could they have been an echo from some precipice of the mountain? I
      knew of no road lying so that, if a horse were galloping upon it, the
      sounds would be reflected from the mountain to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, in one of my rambles, I found myself near the cottage of my
      old foster-mother, who was distantly related to us, and was a trusted
      servant in the family at the time I was born. On the death of my mother,
      which took place almost immediately after my birth, she had taken the
      entire charge of me, and had brought me up, though with difficulty; for
      she used to tell me, I should never be either <i>folk</i> or <i>fairy</i>.
      For some years she had lived alone in a cottage, at the bottom of a deep
      green circular hollow, upon which, in walking over a healthy table-land,
      one came with a sudden surprise. I was her frequent visitor. She was a
      tall, thin, aged woman, with eager eyes, and well-defined clear-cut
      features. Her voice was harsh, but with an undertone of great tenderness.
      She was scrupulously careful in her attire, which was rather above her
      station. Altogether, she had much the bearing of a gentle-woman. Her
      devotion to me was quite motherly. Never having had any family of her own,
      although she had been the wife of one of my father&rsquo;s shepherds, she
      expended the whole maternity of her nature upon me. She was always my
      first resource in any perplexity, for I was sure of all the help she could
      give me. And as she had much influence with my father, who was rather
      severe in his notions, I had had occasion to beg her interference. No
      necessity of this sort, however, had led to my visit on the present
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran down the side of the basin, and entered the little cottage. Nurse
      was seated on a chair by the wall, with her usual knitting, a stocking, in
      one hand; but her hands were motionless, and her eyes wide open and fixed.
      I knew that the neighbours stood rather in awe of her, on the ground that
      she had the second sight; but, although she often told us frightful enough
      stories, she had never alluded to such a gift as being in her possession.
      Now I concluded at once that she was <i>seeing</i>. I was confirmed in
      this conclusion when, seeming to come to herself suddenly, she covered her
      head with her plaid, and sobbed audibly, in spite of her efforts to
      command herself. But I did not dare to ask her any questions, nor did she
      attempt any excuse for her behaviour. After a few moments, she unveiled
      herself, rose, and welcomed me with her usual kindness; then got me some
      refreshment, and began to question me about matters at home. After a
      pause, she said suddenly: &ldquo;When are you going to get your commission,
      Duncan, do you know?&rdquo; I replied that I had heard nothing of it; that I did
      not think my father had influence or money enough to procure me one, and
      that I feared I should have no such good chance of distinguishing myself.
      She did not answer, but nodded her head three times, slowly and with
      compressed lips&mdash;apparently as much as to say, &ldquo;I know better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was leaving her, it occurred to me to mention that I had heard
      an odd sound the night before. She turned towards me, and looked at me
      fixedly. &ldquo;What was it like, Duncan, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a horse galloping with a loose shoe,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duncan, Duncan, my darling!&rdquo; she said, in a low, trembling voice, but
      with passionate earnestness, &ldquo;you did not hear it? Tell me that you did
      not hear it! You only want to frighten poor old nurse: some one has been
      telling you the story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was my turn to be frightened now; for the matter became at once
      associated with my fears as to the possible nature of my auricular
      peculiarities. I assured her that nothing was farther from my intention
      than to frighten her; that, on the contrary, she had rather alarmed me;
      and I begged her to explain. But she sat down white and trembling, and did
      not speak. Presently, however, she rose again, and saying, &ldquo;I have known
      it happen sometimes without anything very bad following,&rdquo; began to put
      away the basin and plate I had been using, as if she would compel herself
      to be calm before me. I renewed my entreaties for an explanation, but
      without avail. She begged me to be content for a few days, as she was
      quite unable to tell the story at present. She promised, however, of her
      own accord, that before I left home she would tell me all she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day a letter arrived announcing the death of a distant relation,
      through whose influence my father had had a lingering hope of obtaining an
      appointment for me. There was nothing left but to look out for a situation
      as tutor.

      CHAPTER III. <i>My Old Nurses Story</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was now almost nineteen. I had completed the usual curriculum of study
      at one of the Scotch universities; and, possessed of a fair knowledge of
      mathematics and physics, and what I considered rather more than a good
      foundation for classical and metaphysical acquirement, I resolved to apply
      for the first suitable situation that offered. But I was spared the
      trouble. A certain Lord Hilton, an English nobleman, residing in one of
      the midland counties, having heard that one of my father&rsquo;s sons was
      desirous of such a situation, wrote to him, offering me the post of tutor
      to his two boys, of the ages of ten and twelve. He had been partly
      educated at a Scotch university; and this, it may be, had prejudiced him
      in favour of a Scotch tutor; while an ancient alliance of the families by
      marriage was supposed by my nurse to be the reason of his offering me the
      situation. Of this connection, however, my father said nothing to me, and
      it went for nothing in my anticipations. I was to receive a hundred pounds
      a year, and to hold in the family the position of a gentleman, which might
      mean anything or nothing, according to the disposition of the heads of the
      family. Preparations for my departure were immediately commenced. I set
      out one evening for the cottage of my old nurse, to bid her good-bye for
      many months, probably years. I was to leave the next day for Edinburgh, on
      my way to London, whence I had to repair by coach to my new abode&mdash;almost
      to me like the land beyond the grave, so little did I know about it, and
      so wide was the separation between it and my home. The evening was sultry
      when I began my walk, and before I arrived at its end, the clouds rising
      from all quarters of the horizon, and especially gathering around the
      peaks of the mountain, betokened the near approach of a thunderstorm. This
      was a great delight to me. Gladly would I take leave of my home with the
      memory of a last night of tumultuous magnificence; followed, probably, by
      a day of weeping rain, well suited to the mood of my own heart in bidding
      farewell to the best of parents and the dearest of homes. Besides, in
      common with most Scotchmen who are young and hardy enough to be unable to
      realise the existence of coughs and rheumatic fevers, it was a positive
      pleasure to me to be out in rain, hail, or snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come to bid you good-bye, Margaret; and to hear the story which you
      promised to tell me before I left home: I go to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you go so soon, my darling? Well, it will be an awful night to tell it
      in; but, as I promised, I suppose I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, two or three great drops of rain, the first of the storm,
      fell down the wide chimney, exploding in the clear turf-fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed you must,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short pause, she commenced. Of course she spoke in Gaelic; and I
      translate from my recollection of the Gaelic; but rather from the
      impression left upon my mind, than from any recollection of the words. She
      drew her chair near the fire, which we had reason to fear would soon be
      put out by the falling rain, and began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old the story is, I do not know. It has come down through many
      generations. My grandmother told it to me as I tell it to you; and her
      mother and my mother sat beside, never interrupting, but nodding their
      heads at every turn. Almost it ought to begin like the fairy tales, <i>Once
      upon a time,</i>&mdash;it took place so long ago; but it is too dreadful
      and too true to tell like a fairy tale.&mdash;There were two brothers,
      sons of the chief of our clan, but as different in appearance and
      disposition as two men could be. The elder was fair-haired and strong,
      much given to hunting and fishing; fighting too, upon occasion, I dare
      say, when they made a foray upon the Saxon, to get back a mouthful of
      their own. But he was gentleness itself to every one about him, and the
      very soul of honour in all his doings. The younger was very dark in
      complexion, and tall and slender compared to his brother. He was very fond
      of book-learning, which, they say, was an uncommon taste in those times.
      He did not care for any sports or bodily exercises but one; and that, too,
      was unusual in these parts. It was horsemanship. He was a fierce rider,
      and as much at home in the saddle as in his study-chair. You may think
      that, so long ago, there was not much fit room for riding hereabouts; but,
      fit or not fit, he rode. From his reading and riding, the neighbours
      looked doubtfully upon him, and whispered about the black art. He usually
      bestrode a great powerful black horse, without a white hair on him; and
      people said it was either the devil himself, or a demon-horse from the
      devil&rsquo;s own stud. What favoured this notion was, that, in or out of the
      stable, the brute would let no other than his master go near him. Indeed,
      no one would venture, after he had killed two men, and grievously maimed a
      third, tearing him with his teeth and hoofs like a wild beast. But to his
      master he was obedient as a hound, and would even tremble in his presence
      sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The youth&rsquo;s temper corresponded to his habits. He was both gloomy and
      passionate. Prone to anger, he had never been known to forgive. Debarred
      from anything on which he had set his heart, he would have gone mad with
      longing if he had not gone mad with rage. His soul was like the night
      around us now, dark, and sultry, and silent, but lighted up by the red
      levin of wrath and torn by the bellowings of thunder-passion. He must have
      his will: hell might have his soul. Imagine, then, the rage and malice in
      his heart, when he suddenly became aware that an orphan girl, distantly
      related to them, who had lived with them for nearly two years, and whom he
      had loved for almost all that period, was loved by his elder brother, and
      loved him in return. He flung his right hand above his head, swore a
      terrible oath that if he might not, his brother should not, rushed out of
      the house, and galloped off among the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The orphan was a beautiful girl, tall, pale, and slender, with plentiful
      dark hair, which, when released from the snood, rippled down below her
      knees. Her appearance formed a strong contrast with that of her favoured
      lover, while there was some resemblance between her and the younger
      brother. This fact seemed, to his fierce selfishness, ground for a prior
      claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may appear strange that a man like him should not have had instant
      recourse to his superior and hidden knowledge, by means of which he might
      have got rid of his rival with far more of certainty and less of risk; but
      I presume that, for the moment, his passion overwhelmed his consciousness
      of skill. Yet I do not suppose that he foresaw the mode in which his
      hatred was about to operate. At the moment when he learned their mutual
      attachment, probably through a domestic, the lady was on her way to meet
      her lover as he returned from the day&rsquo;s sport. The appointed place was on
      the edge of a deep, rocky ravine, down in whose dark bosom brawled and
      foamed a little mountain torrent. You know the place, Duncan, my dear, I
      dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Here she gave me a minute description of the spot, with directions how to
      find it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether any one saw what I am about to relate, or whether it was put
      together afterwards, I cannot tell. The story is like an old tree&mdash;so
      old that it has lost the marks of its growth. But this is how my
      grandmother told it to me.&mdash;An evil chance led him in the right
      direction. The lovers, startled by the sound of the approaching horse,
      parted in opposite directions along a narrow mountain-path on the edge of
      the ravine. Into this path he struck at a point near where the lovers had
      met, but to opposite sides of which they had now receded; so that he was
      between them on the path. Turning his horse up the course of the stream,
      he soon came in sight of his brother on the ledge before him. With a
      suppressed scream of rage, he rode head-long at him, and ere he had time
      to make the least defence, hurled him over the precipice. The helplessness
      of the strong man was uttered in one single despairing cry as he shot into
      the abyss. Then all was still. The sound of his fall could not reach the
      edge of the gulf. Divining in a moment that the lady, whose name was
      Elsie, must have fled in the opposite direction, he reined his steed on
      his haunches. He could touch the precipice with his bridle-hand half
      outstretched; his sword-hand half outstretched would have dropped a stone
      to the bottom of the ravine. There was no room to wheel. One desperate
      practicability alone remained. Turning his horse&rsquo;s head towards the edge,
      he compelled him, by means of the powerful bit, to rear till he stood
      almost erect; and so, his body swaying over the gulf, with quivering and
      straining muscles, to turn on his hind-legs. Having completed the
      half-circle, he let him drop, and urged him furiously in the opposite
      direction. It must have been by the devil&rsquo;s own care that he was able to
      continue his gallop along that ledge of rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He soon caught sight of the maiden. She was leaning, half fainting,
      against the precipice. She had heard her lover&rsquo;s last cry, and although it
      had conveyed no suggestion of his voice to her ear, she trembled from head
      to foot, and her limbs would bear her no farther. He checked his speed,
      rode gently up to her, lifted her unresisting, laid her across the
      shoulders of his horse, and, riding carefully till he reached a more open
      path, dashed again wildly along the mountain-side. The lady&rsquo;s long hair
      was shaken loose, and dropped trailing on the ground. The horse trampled
      upon it, and stumbled, half dragging her from the saddle-bow. He caught
      her, lifted her up, and looked at her face. She was dead. I suppose he
      went mad. He laid her again across the saddle before him, and rode on,
      reckless whither. Horse, and man, and maiden were found the next day,
      lying at the foot of a cliff, dashed to pieces. It was observed that a
      hind-shoe of the horse was loose and broken. Whether this had been the
      cause of his fall, could not be told; but ever when he races, as race he
      will, till the day of doom, along that mountain-side, his gallop is
      mingled with the clank of the loose and broken shoe. For, like the sin,
      the punishment is awful: he shall carry about for ages the phantom-body of
      the girl, knowing that her soul is away, sitting with the soul of his
      brother, down in the deep ravine, or scaling with him the topmost crags of
      the towering mountain-peaks. There are some who, from time to time, see
      the doomed man careering along the face of the mountain, with the lady
      hanging across the steed; and they say it always betokens a storm, such as
      this which is now raving around us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not noticed till now, so absorbed had I been in her tale, that the
      storm had risen to a very ecstasy of fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say, likewise, that the lady&rsquo;s hair is still growing; for, every
      time they see her, it is longer than before; and that now such is its
      length and the head-long speed of the horse, that it floats and streams
      out behind, like one of those curved clouds, like a comet&rsquo;s tail, far up
      in the sky; only the cloud is white, and the hair dark as night. And they
      say it will go on growing till the Last Day, when the horse will falter
      and her hair will gather in; and the horse will fall, and the hair will
      twist, and twine, and wreathe itself like a mist of threads about him, and
      blind him to everything but her. Then the body will rise up within it,
      face to face with him, animated by a fiend, who, twining her arms around
      him, will drag him down to the bottomless pit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I may mention something which now occurred, and which had a strange effect
      on my old nurse. It illustrates the assertion that we see around us only
      what is within us: marvellous things enough will show themselves to the
      marvellous mood.&mdash;During a short lull in the storm, just as she had
      finished her story, we heard the sound of iron-shod hoofs approaching the
      cottage. There was no bridle-way into the glen. A knock came to the door,
      and, on opening it, we saw an old man seated on a horse, with a long
      slenderly-filled sack lying across the saddle before him. He said he had
      lost the path in the storm, and, seeing the light, had scrambled down to
      inquire his way. I perceived at once, from the scared and mysterious look
      of the old woman&rsquo;s eyes, that she was persuaded that this appearance had
      more than a little to do with the awful rider, the terrific storm, and
      myself who had heard the sound of the phantom-hoofs. As he ascended the
      hill, she looked after him, with wide and pale but unshrinking eyes; then
      turning in, shut and locked the door behind her, as by a natural instinct.
      After two or three of her significant nods, accompanied by the compression
      of her lips, she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He need not think to take me in, wizard as he is, with his disguises. I
      can see him through them all. Duncan, my dear, when you suspect anything,
      do not be too incredulous. This human demon is of course a wizard still,
      and knows how to make himself, as well as anything he touches, take a
      quite different appearance from the real one; only every appearance must
      bear some resemblance, however distant, to the natural form. That man you
      saw at the door was the phantom of which I have been telling you. What he
      is after now, of course, I cannot tell; but you must keep a bold heart,
      and a firm and wary foot, as you go home to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I showed some surprise, I do not doubt; and, perhaps, some fear as well;
      but I only said, &ldquo;How do you know him, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly tell you,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but I do know him. I think he hates
      me. Often, of a wild night, when there is moonlight enough by fits, I see
      him tearing around this little valley, just on the top edge&mdash;all
      round; the lady&rsquo;s hair and the horses mane and tail driving far behind,
      and mingling, vaporous, with the stormy clouds. About he goes, in wild
      careering gallop; now lost as the moon goes in, then visible far round
      when she looks out again&mdash;an airy, pale-grey spectre, which few eyes
      but mine could see; for, as far as I am aware, no one of the family but
      myself has ever possessed the double gift of seeing and hearing both. In
      this case I hear no sound, except now and then a clank from the broken
      shoe. But I did not mean to tell you that I had ever seen him. I am not a
      bit afraid of him. He cannot do more than he may. His power is limited;
      else ill enough would he work, the miscreant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what has all this, terrible as it is, to do with the
      fright you took at my telling you that I had heard the sound of the broken
      shoe? Surely you are not afraid of only a storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my boy; I fear no storm. But the fact is, that that sound is seldom
      heard, and never, as far as I know, by any of the blood of that wicked
      man, without betokening some ill to one of the family, and most probably
      to the one who hears it&mdash;but I am not quite sure about that. Only
      some evil it does portend, although a long time may elapse before it shows
      itself; and I have a hope it may mean some one else than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not wish that,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I know no one better able to bear it than
      I am; and I hope, whatever it may be, that I only shall have to meet it.
      It must surely be something serious to be so foretold&mdash;it can hardly
      be connected with my disappointment in being compelled to be a pedagogue
      instead of a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trouble yourself about that, Duncan,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;A soldier you
      must be. The same day you told me of the clank of the broken horseshoe, I
      saw you return wounded from battle, and fall fainting from your horse in
      the street of a great city&mdash;only fainting, thank God. But I have
      particular reasons for being uneasy at your hearing that boding sound. Can
      you tell me the day and hour of your birth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It seems very odd when I think of it, but I really do
      not know even the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor any one else; which is stranger still,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does that happen, nurse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were in terrible anxiety about your mother at the time. So ill was
      she, after you were just born, in a strange, unaccountable way, that you
      lay almost neglected for more than an hour. In the very act of giving
      birth to you, she seemed to the rest around her to be out of her mind, so
      wildly did she talk; but I knew better. I knew that she was fighting some
      evil power; and what power it was, I knew full well; for twice, during her
      pains, I heard the click of the horseshoe. But no one could help her.
      After her delivery, she lay as if in a trance, neither dead, nor at rest,
      but as if frozen to ice, and conscious of it all the while. Once more I
      heard the terrible sound of iron; and, at the moment, your mother started
      from her trance, screaming, &lsquo;My child! my child!&rsquo; We suddenly became aware
      that no one had attended to the child, and rushed to the place where he
      lay wrapped in a blanket. Uncovering him, we found him black in the face,
      and spotted with dark spots upon the throat. I thought he was dead; but,
      with great and almost hopeless pains, we succeeded in making him breathe,
      and he gradually recovered. But his mother continued dreadfully exhausted.
      It seemed as if she had spent her life for her child&rsquo;s defence and birth.
      That was you, Duncan, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in constant attendance upon her. About a week after your birth, as
      near as I can guess, just in the gloaming, I heard yet again the awful
      clank&mdash;only once. Nothing followed till about midnight. Your mother
      slept, and you lay asleep beside her. I sat by the bedside. A horror fell
      upon me suddenly, though I neither saw nor heard anything. Your mother
      started from her sleep with a cry, which sounded as if it came from far
      away, out of a dream, and did not belong to this world. My blood curdled
      with fear. She sat up in bed, with wide staring eyes and half-open rigid
      lips, and, feeble as she was, thrust her arms straight out before her with
      great force, her hands open and lifted up, with the palms outwards. The
      whole action was of one violently repelling another. She began to talk
      wildly as she had done before you were born, but, though I seemed to hear
      and understand it all at the time, I could not recall a word of it
      afterwards. It was as if I had listened to it when half asleep. I
      attempted to soothe her, putting my arms round her, but she seemed quite
      unconscious of my presence, and my arms seemed powerless upon the fixed
      muscles of hers. Not that I tried to constrain her, for I knew that a
      battle was going on of some kind or other, and my interference might do
      awful mischief. I only tried to comfort and encourage her. All the time, I
      was in a state of indescribable cold and suffering, whether more bodily or
      mental I could not tell. But at length I heard yet again the clank of the
      shoe A sudden peace seemed to fall upon my mind&mdash;or was it a warm,
      odorous wind that filled the room? Your mother dropped her arms, and
      turned feebly towards her baby. She saw that he slept a blessed sleep. She
      smiled like a glorified spirit, and fell back exhausted on the pillow. I
      went to the other side of the room to get a cordial. When I returned to
      the bedside, I saw at once that she was dead. Her face smiled still, with
      an expression of the uttermost bliss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nurse ceased, trembling as overcome by the recollection; and I was too
      much moved and awed to speak. At length, resuming the conversation, she
      said: &ldquo;You see it is no wonder, Duncan, my dear, if, after all this, I
      should find, when I wanted to fix the date of your birth, that I could not
      determine the day or the hour when it took place. All was confusion in my
      poor brain. But it was strange that no one else could, any more than I.
      One thing only I can tell you about it. As I carried you across the room
      to lay you down, for I assisted at your birth, I happened to look up to
      the window. Then I saw what I did not forget, although I did not think of
      it again till many days after,&mdash;a bright star was shining on the very
      tip of the thin crescent moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is possible to determine the day and the very hour
      when my birth took place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See the good of book-learning!&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;When you work it out, just
      let me know, my dear, that I may remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence of some moments followed. Margaret resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you will laugh at my foolish fancies, Duncan; but in thinking
      over all these things, as you may suppose I often do, lying awake in my
      lonely bed, the notion sometimes comes to me: What if my Duncan be the
      youth whom his wicked brother hurled into the ravine, come again in a new
      body, to live out his life on the earth, cut short by his brother&rsquo;s
      hatred? If so, his persecution of you, and of your mother for your sake,
      is easy to understand. And if so, you will never be able to rest till you
      find your fere, wherever she may have been born on the face of the earth.
      For born she must be, long ere now, for you to find. I misdoubt me much,
      however, if you will find her without great conflict and suffering
      between, for the Powers of Darkness will be against you; though I have
      good hope that you will overcome at last. You must forgive the fancies of
      a foolish old woman, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I will not try to describe the strange feelings, almost sensations, that
      arose in me while listening to these extraordinary utterances, lest it
      should be supposed I was ready to believe all that Margaret narrated or
      concluded. I could not help doubting her sanity; but no more could I help
      feeling very peculiarly moved by her narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few more words were spoken on either side, but after receiving renewed
      exhortations to carefulness on my way home, I said good-bye to dear old
      nurse, considerably comforted, I must confess, that I was not doomed to be
      a tutor all my days; for I never questioned the truth of that vision and
      its consequent prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out into the midst of the storm, into the alternating throbs of
      blackness and radiance; now the possessor of no more room than what my
      body filled, and now isolated in world-wide space. And the thunder seemed
      to follow me, bellowing after me as I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in the story I had heard, I took my way, as I thought, homewards.
      The whole country was well known to me. I should have said, before that
      night, that I could have gone home blindfold. Whether the lightning
      bewildered me and made me take a false turn, I cannot tell; for the
      hardest thing to understand, in intellectual as well as moral mistakes, is&mdash;how
      we came to go wrong. But after wandering for some time, plunged in
      meditation, and with no warning whatever of the presence of inimical
      powers, a brilliant lightning-flash showed me that at least I was not near
      home. The light was prolonged for a second or two by a slight electric
      pulsation; and by that I distinguished a wide space of blackness on the
      ground in front of me. Once more wrapped in the folds of a thick darkness,
      I dared not move. Suddenly it occurred to me what the blackness was, and
      whither I had wandered. It was a huge quarry, of great depth, long
      disused, and half filled with water. I knew the place perfectly. A few
      more steps would have carried me over the brink. I stood still, waiting
      for the next flash, that I might be quite sure of the way I was about to
      take before I ventured to move. While I stood, I fancied I heard a single
      hollow plunge in the black water far below. When the lightning came, I
      turned, and took my path in another direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking for some time across the heath, I fell. The fall became a
      roll, and down a steep declivity I went, over and over, arriving at the
      bottom uninjured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another flash soon showed me where I was-in the hollow valley, within a
      couple of hundred yards from nurse&rsquo;s cottage. I made my way towards it.
      There was no light in it, except the feeblest glow from the embers of her
      peat fire. &ldquo;She is in bed,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;and I will not disturb
      her.&rdquo; Yet something drew me towards the little window. I looked in. At
      first I could see nothing. At length, as I kept gazing, I saw something,
      indistinct in the darkness, like an outstretched human form.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the storm had lulled. The moon had been up for some time, but
      had been quite concealed by tempestuous clouds. Now, however, these had
      begun to break up; and, while I stood looking into the cottage, they
      scattered away from the face of the moon, and a faint vapoury gleam of her
      light, entering the cottage through a window opposite that at which I
      stood, fell directly on the face of my old nurse, as she lay on her back,
      outstretched upon chairs, pale as death, and with her eyes closed. The
      light fell nowhere but on her face. A stranger to her habits would have
      thought she was dead; but she had so much of the appearance she had had on
      a former occasion, that I concluded at once she was in one of her trances.
      But having often heard that persons in such a condition ought not to be
      disturbed, and feeling quite sure she knew best how to manage herself, I
      turned, though reluctantly, and left the lone cottage behind me in the
      night, with the death-like woman lying motionless in the midst of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found my way home without any further difficulty, and went to bed, where
      I soon fell asleep, thoroughly wearied, more by the mental excitement I
      had been experiencing than by the amount of bodily exercise I had gone
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sleep was tormented with awful dreams; yet, strange to say, I awoke in
      the morning refreshed and fearless. The sun was shining through the chinks
      in my shutters, which had been closed because of the storm, and was making
      streaks and bands of golden brilliancy upon the wall. I had dressed and
      completed my preparations long before I heard the steps of the servant who
      came to call me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a wonderful thing waking is! The time of the ghostly moonshine passes
      by, and the great positive sunlight comes. A man who dreams, and knows
      that he is dreaming, thinks he knows what waking is; but knows it so
      little, that he mistakes, one after another, many a vague and dim change
      in his dream for an awaking. When the true waking comes at last, he is
      filled and overflowed with the power of its reality. So, likewise, one
      who, in the darkness, lies waiting for the light about to be struck, and
      trying to conceive, with all the force of his imagination, what the light
      will be like, is yet, when the reality flames up before him, seized as by
      a new and unexpected thing, different from and beyond all his imagining.
      He feels as if the darkness were cast to an infinite distance behind him.
      So shall it be with us when we wake from this dream of life into the truer
      life beyond, and find all our present notions of being, thrown back as
      into a dim, vapoury region of dreamland, where yet we thought we knew, and
      whence we looked forward into the present. This must be what Novalis means
      when he says: &ldquo;Our life is not a dream; but it may become a dream, and
      perhaps ought to become one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so I looked back upon the strange history of my past; sometimes asking
      myself,&mdash;&ldquo;Can it be that all this realty happened to the same <i>me</i>,
      who am now thinking about it in doubt and wonder?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV. <i>Hilton Hall</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As my father accompanied me to the door, where the gig, which was to carry
      me over the first stage of my journey, was in waiting, a large target of
      hide, well studded with brass nails, which had hung in the hall for time
      unknown&mdash;to me, at least&mdash;fell on the floor with a dull bang. My
      father started, but said nothing; and, as it seemed to me, rather pressed
      my departure than otherwise. I would have replaced the old piece of armour
      before I went, but he would not allow me to touch it, saying, with a grim
      smile,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that for an omen, my boy, that your armour must be worn over the
      conscience, and not over the body. Be a man, Duncan, my boy. Fear nothing,
      and do your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A grasp of the hand was all the good-bye I could make; and I was soon
      rattling away to meet the coach <i>for Edinburgh and London. Seated on the
      top, I</i> was soon buried in a reverie, from which I was suddenly
      startled by the sound of tinkling iron. Could it be that my adversary was
      riding unseen alongside of the coach? Was that the clank of the ominous
      shoe? But I soon discovered the cause of the sound, and laughed at my own
      apprehensiveness. For I observed that the sound was repeated every time
      that we passed any trees by the wayside, and that it was the peculiar echo
      they gave of the loose chain and steel work about the harness. The sound
      was quite different from that thrown back by the houses on the road. I
      became perfectly familiar with it before the day was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached London in safety, and slept at the house of an old friend of my
      father, who treated me with great kindness, and seemed altogether to take
      a liking to me. Before I left he held out a hope of being able, some day
      or other, to procure for me what I so much desired&mdash;a commission in
      the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending a day or two with him, and seeing something of London, I
      climbed once more on the roof of a coach; and, late in the afternoon, was
      set down at the great gate of Hilton Hall. I walked up the broad avenue,
      through the final arch of which, as through a huge Gothic window, I saw
      the hall in the distance. Everything about me looked strange, rich, and
      lovely. Accustomed to the scanty flowers and diminutive wood of my own
      country, what I now saw gave me a feeling of majestic plenty, which I can
      recall at will, but which I have never experienced again. Behind the trees
      which formed the avenue, I saw a shrubbery, composed entirely of flowering
      plants, almost all unknown to me. Issuing from the avenue, I found myself
      amid open, wide, lawny spaces, in which the flower-beds lay like islands
      of colour. A statue on a pedestal, the only white thing in the surrounding
      green, caught my eye. I had seen scarcely any sculpture; and this,
      attracting my attention by a favourite contrast of colour, retained it by
      its own beauty. It was a Dryad, or some nymph of the woods, who had just
      glided from the solitude of the trees behind, and had sprung upon the
      pedestal to look wonderingly around her. A few large brown leaves lay at
      her feet, borne thither by some eddying wind from the trees behind. As I
      gazed, filled with a new pleasure, a drop of rain upon my face made me
      look up. From a grey, fleecy cloud, with sun-whitened border, a light,
      gracious, plentiful rain was falling. A rainbow sprang across the sky, and
      the statue stood within the rainbow. At the same moment, from the base of
      the pedestal rose a figure in white, graceful as the Dryad above, and
      neither running, nor appearing to walk quickly, yet fleet as a ghost,
      glided past me at a few paces, distance, and, keeping in a straight line
      for the main entrance of the hall, entered by it and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed in the direction of the mansion, which was large, and of
      several styles and ages. One wing appeared especially ancient. It was
      neglected and out of repair, and had in consequence a desolate, almost
      sepulchral look, an expression heightened by the number of large cypresses
      which grew along its line. I went up to the central door and knocked. It
      was opened by a grave, elderly butler. I passed under its flat arch, as if
      into the midst of the waiting events of my story. For, as I glanced around
      the hall, my consciousness was suddenly saturated, if I may be allowed the
      expression, with the strange feeling&mdash;known to everyone, and yet so
      strange&mdash;that I had seen it before; that, in fact, I knew it
      perfectly. But what was yet more strange, and far more uncommon, was,
      that, although the feeling with regard to the hall faded and vanished
      instantly, and although I could not in the least surmise the appearance of
      any of the regions into which I was about to be ushered, I yet followed
      the butler with a kind of indefinable expectation of seeing something
      which I had seen before; and every room or passage in that mansion
      affected me, on entering it for the first time, with the same sensation of
      previous acquaintance which I had experienced with regard to the hall.
      This sensation, in every case, died away at once, leaving that portion
      such as it might be expected to look to one who had never before entered
      the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was received by the housekeeper, a little, prim, benevolent old lady,
      with colourless face and antique head-dress, who led me to the room
      prepared for me. To my surprise, I found a large wood-fire burning on the
      hearth; but the feeling of the place revealed at once the necessity for
      it; and I scarcely needed to be informed that the room, which was upon the
      ground floor, and looked out upon a little solitary grass-grown and
      ivy-mantled court, had not been used for years, and therefore required to
      be thus prepared for an inmate. My bedroom was a few paces down a passage
      to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, I proceeded to make a more critical survey of my room. Its
      look of ancient mystery was to me incomparably more attractive than any
      show of elegance or comfort could have been. It was large and low,
      panelled throughout in oak, black with age, and worm-eaten in many parts&mdash;otherwise
      entire. Both the windows looked into the little court or yard before
      mentioned. All the heavier furniture of the room was likewise of black
      oak, but the chairs and couches were covered with faded tapestry and
      tarnished gilding, apparently the superannuated members of the general
      household of seats. I could give an individual description of each, for
      every atom in that room, large enough for discernable shape or colour,
      seems branded into my brain. If I happen to have the least feverishness on
      me, the moment I fall asleep, I am in that room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. <i>Lady Alice</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the bell rang for dinner, I managed to find my way to the
      drawing-room, where were assembled Lady Hilton, her only daughter, a girl
      of about thirteen, and the two boys, my pupils. Lady Hilton would have
      been pleasant, could she have been as natural as she wished to appear. She
      received me with some degree of kindness; but the half-cordiality of her
      manner towards me was evidently founded on the impassableness of the gulf
      between us. I knew at once that we should never be friends; that she would
      never come down from the lofty table-land upon which she walked; and that
      if, after being years in the house, I should happen to be dying, she would
      send the housekeeper to me. All right, no doubt; I only say that it was
      so. She introduced to me my pupils; fine, open-eyed, manly English boys,
      with something a little overbearing in their manner, which speedily
      disappeared in relation to me. Lord Hilton was not at home. Lady Hilton
      led the way to the dining-room; the elder boy gave his arm to his sister,
      and I was about to follow with the younger, when from one of the deep bay
      windows glided out, still in white, the same figure which had passed me
      upon the lawn. I started, and drew back. With a slight bow, she preceded
      me, and followed the others down the great staircase. Seated at table, I
      had leisure to make my observations upon them all; but most of my glances
      found their way to the lady who, twice that day, had affected me like an
      apparition. What is time, but the airy ocean in which ghosts come and go!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about twenty years of age; rather above the middle height, and
      rather slight in form; her complexion white rather than pale, her face
      being only less white than the deep marbly whiteness of her arms. Her eyes
      were large, and full of liquid night&mdash;a night throbbing with the
      light of invisible stars. Her hair seemed raven-black, and in quantity
      profuse. The expression of her face, however, generally partook more of
      vagueness than any other characteristic. Lady Hilton called her Lady
      Alice; and she never addressed Lady Hilton but in the same ceremonious
      style.
    </p>
    <p>
      I afterwards learned from the old house-keeper, that Lady Alice&rsquo;s position
      in the family was a very peculiar one. Distantly connected with Lord
      Hilton&rsquo;s family on the mother&rsquo;s side, she was the daughter of the late
      Lord Glendarroch, and step-daughter to Lady Hilton, who had become Lady
      Hilton within a year after Lord Glendarroch&rsquo;s death. Lady Alice, then
      quite a child, had accompanied her stepmother, to whom she was moderately
      attached, and who had been allowed to retain undisputed possession of her.
      She had no near relatives, else the fortune I afterwards found to be at
      her disposal would have aroused contending claims to the right of
      guardianship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although she was in many respects kindly treated by her stepmother,
      certain peculiarities tended to her isolation from the family pursuits and
      pleasures. Lady Alice had no accomplishments. She could neither spell her
      own language, nor even read it aloud. Yet she delighted in reading to
      herself, though, for the most part, books which Mrs. Wilson characterised
      as very odd. Her voice, when she spoke, had a quite indescribable music in
      it; yet she neither sang nor played. Her habitual motion was more like a
      rhythmical gliding than an ordinary walk, yet she could not dance. Mrs.
      Wilson hinted at other and more serious peculiarities, which she either
      could not, or would not describe; always shaking her head gravely and
      sadly, and becoming quite silent, when I pressed for further explanation;
      so that, at last, I gave up all attempts to arrive at an understanding of
      the mystery by her means. Not the less, however, I speculated on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing soon became evident to me: that she was considered not merely
      deficient as to the power of intellectual acquirement, but in a quite
      abnormal intellectual condition. Of this, however, I could myself see no
      sign. The peculiarity, almost oddity, of some of her remarks, was
      evidently not only misunderstood, but, with relation to her mental state,
      misinterpreted. Such remarks Lady Hilton generally answered only by an
      elongation of the lips intended to represent a smile. To me, they appeared
      to indicate a nature closely allied to genius, if not identical with it-a
      power of regarding things from an original point of view, which perhaps
      was the more unfettered in its operation from the fact that she was
      incapable of looking at them in the ordinary common-place way. It seemed
      to me, sometimes, as if her point of observation was outside of the sphere
      within which the thing observed took place; and as if what she said, had a
      relation, occasionally, to things and thoughts and mental conditions
      familiar to her, but at which not even a definite guess could be made by
      me. I am compelled to acknowledge, however, that with such utterances as
      these mingled now and then others, silly enough for any drawing-room young
      lady; which seemed again to be accepted by the family as proofs that she
      was not <i>altogether</i> out of her right mind. She was gentle and kind
      to the children, as they were still called; and they seemed reasonably
      fond of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something to me exceedingly touching in the solitariness of this
      girl; for no one spoke to her as if she were like other people, or as if
      any heartiness were possible between them. Perhaps no one could have felt
      quite at home with her but a mother, whose heart had been one with hers
      from a season long anterior to the development of any repulsive oddity.
      But her position was one of peculiar isolation, for no one really
      approached her individual being; and that she should be unaware of this
      loneliness, seemed to me saddest of all. I soon found, however, that the
      most distant attempt on my part to show her attention, was either received
      with absolute indifference, or coldly repelled without the slightest
      acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I return to the first night of my sojourn at Hilton Hall.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. <i>My Quarters.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      After making arrangements for commencing work in the morning, I took my
      leave, and retired to my own room, intent upon carrying out with more
      minuteness the survey I had already commenced: several cupboards in the
      wall, and one or two doors, apparently of closets, had especially
      attracted my attention. Strange was its look as I entered&mdash;as of a
      room hollowed out of the past, for a memorial of dead times. The fire had
      sunk low, and lay smouldering beneath the white ashes, like the life of
      the world beneath the snow, or the heart of a man beneath cold and grey
      thoughts. I lighted the candles which stood upon the table, but the room,
      instead of being brightened looked blacker than before, for the light
      revealed its essential blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I cast my eyes around me, standing with my back to the hearth (on
      which, for mere companionship&rsquo;s sake, I had just heaped fresh wood), a
      thrill ran suddenly throughout my frame. I felt as if, did it last a
      moment longer, I should become aware of another presence in the room; but,
      happily for me, it ceased before it had reached that point; and I,
      recovering my courage, remained ignorant of the cause of my fear, if there
      were any, other than the nature of the room itself. With a candle in my
      hand, I proceeded to open the various cupboards and closets. At first I
      found nothing remarkable about any of them. The latter were quite empty,
      except the last I came to, which had a piece of very old elaborate
      tapestry hanging at the back of it. Lifting this up, I saw what seemed at
      first to be panels, corresponding to those which formed the room; but on
      looking more closely, I discovered that this back of the closet was, or
      had been, a door. There was nothing unusual in this, especially in such an
      old house; but the discovery roused in me a strong desire to know what lay
      behind the old door. I found that it was secured only by an ordinary bolt,
      from which the handle had been removed. Soothing my conscience with the
      reflection that I had a right to know what sort of place had communication
      with my room, I succeeded, by the help of my deer-knife, in forcing back
      the rusty bolt; and though, from the stiffness of the hinges, I dreaded a
      crack, they yielded at last with only a creak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening door revealed a large hall, empty utterly, save of dust and
      cobwebs, which festooned it in all quarters, and gave it an appearance of
      unutterable desolation. The now familiar feeling, that I had seen the
      place before, filled my mind the first moment, and passed away the next. A
      broad, right-angled staircase, with massive banisters, rose from the
      middle of the hall. This staircase could not have originally belonged to
      the ancient wing which I had observed on my first approach, being much
      more modern; but I was convinced, from the observations I had made as to
      the situation of my room, that I was bordering upon, if not within, the
      oldest portion of the pile. In sudden horror, lest I should hear a light
      footfall upon the awful stair, I withdrew hurriedly, and having secured
      both the doors, betook myself to my bedroom; in whose dingy four-post bed,
      with its carving and plumes reminding me of a hearse, I was soon ensconced
      amidst the snowiest linen, with the sweet and clean odour of lavender. In
      spite of novelty, antiquity, speculation, and dread, I was soon fast
      asleep; becoming thereby a fitter inhabitant of such regions, than when I
      moved about with restless and disturbing curiosity, through their ancient
      and death-like repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no use of my discovered door, although I always intended doing so;
      especially after, in talking about the building with Lady Hilton, I found
      that I was at perfect liberty to make what excursions I pleased into the
      deserted portions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My pupils turned out to be teachable, and therefore my occupation was
      pleasant. Their sister frequently came to me for help, as there happened
      to be just then an interregnum of governesses: soon she settled into a
      regular pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few weeks Lord Hilton returned. Though my room was so far from the
      great hall, I heard the clank of his spurs on its pavement. I trembled;
      for it sounded like the broken shoe. But I shook off the influence in a
      moment, heartily ashamed of its power over me. Soon I became familiar
      enough both with the sound and its cause; for his lordship rarely went
      anywhere except on horseback, and was booted and spurred from morning till
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received me with some appearance of interest, which immediately
      stiffened and froze. Beginning to shake hands with me as if he meant it,
      he instantly dropped my hand, as if it had stung him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His nobility was of that sort which stands in constant need of repair.
      Like a weakly constitution, it required keeping up, and his lordship could
      not be said to neglect it; for he seemed to find his principal employment
      in administering continuous doses of obsequiousness to his own pride. His
      rank, like a coat made for some large ancestor, hung loose upon him: he
      was always trying to persuade himself that it was an excellent fit, but
      ever with an unacknowledged misgiving. This misgiving might have done him
      good, had he not met it with renewed efforts at looking that which he
      feared he was not. Yet this man was capable of the utmost persistency in
      carrying out any scheme he had once devised. Enough of him for the
      present: I seldom came into contact with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely ever saw Lady Alice, except at dinner, or by accidental meeting
      in the grounds and passages of the house; and then she took no notice of
      me whatever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. <i>The Library</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day, a week after his arrival, Lord Hilton gave a dinner-party to some
      of his neighbours and tenants. I entered the drawing-room rather late, and
      saw that, though there were many guests, not one was talking to Lady
      Alice. She appeared, however, altogether unconscious of neglect. Presently
      dinner was announced, and the company marshalled themselves, and took
      their way to the dining-room. Lady Alice was left unattended, the guests
      taking their cue from the behaviour of their entertainers. I ventured to
      go up to her, and offer her my arm. She made me a haughty bow, and passed
      on before me unaccompanied. I could not help feeling hurt at this, and I
      think she saw it; but it made no difference to her behaviour, except that
      she avoided everything that might occasion me the chance of offering my
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did I get any further with Lady Hilton. Her manner and smile remained
      precisely the same as on our first interview. She did not even show any
      interest in the fact that her daughter, Lady Lucy, had joined her brothers
      in the schoolroom. I had an uncomfortable feeling that the latter was like
      her mother, and was not to be trusted. Self-love is the foulest of all
      foul feeders, and will defile that it may devour. But I must not
      anticipate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neglected library was open to me at all hours; and in it I often took
      refuge from the dreariness of unsympathetic society. I was never admitted
      within the magic circle of the family interests and enjoyments. If there
      was such a circle, Lady Alice and I certainly stood outside of it; but
      whether even then it had any real inside to it, I doubted much.
      Nevertheless, as I have said, our common exclusion had not the effect of
      bringing us together as sharers of the same misfortune. In the library I
      found companions more to my need. But, even there, they were not easy to
      find; for the books were in great confusion. I could discover no
      catalogue, nor could I hear of the existence of such a useless luxury. One
      morning at breakfast, therefore, I asked Lord Hilton if I might arrange
      and catalogue the books during my leisure hours. He replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do anything you like with them, Mr. Campbell, except destroy them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I was in my element. I never had been by any means a book-worm; but
      the very outside of a book had a charm to me. It was a kind of sacrament&mdash;an
      outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace; as, indeed,
      what on God&rsquo;s earth is not? So I set to work amongst the books, and soon
      became familiar with many titles at least, which had been perfectly
      unknown to me before. I found a perfect set of our poets-perfect according
      to the notion of the editor and the issue of the publisher, although it
      omitted both Chaucer and George Herbert. I began to nibble at that portion
      of the collection which belonged to the sixteenth century; but with little
      success. I found nothing, to my idea, but love poems without any love in
      them, and so I soon became weary. But I found in the library what I liked
      far better&mdash;many romances of a very marvellous sort, and plentiful
      interruption they gave to the formation of the catalogue. I likewise came
      upon a whole nest of the German classics which seemed to have kept their
      places undisturbed, in virtue of their unintelligibility. There must have
      been some well-read scholar in the family, and that not long before, to
      judge by the near approach of the line of this literature; happening to be
      a tolerable reader of German, I found in these volumes a mine of wealth
      inexhaustible. I learned from Mrs. Wilson that this scholar was a younger
      brother of Lord Hilton, who had died about twenty years before. He had led
      a retired, rather lonely life, was of a melancholy and brooding
      disposition, and was reported to have had an unfortunate love-story. This
      was one of many histories which she gave me. For the library being dusty
      as a catacomb, the private room of Old Time himself, I had often to betake
      myself to her for assistance. The good lady had far more regard than the
      owners of it for the library, and was delighted with the pains I was
      taking to re-arrange and clean it. She would allow no one to help me but
      herself; and to many a long-winded story, most of which I forgot as soon
      as I heard them, did I listen, or seem to listen, while she dusted the
      shelves and I the books.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I had sent a servant to ask Mrs. Wilson to come to me. I had taken
      down all the books from a hitherto undisturbed corner, and had seated
      myself on a heap of them, no doubt a very impersonation of the genius of
      the place; for while I waited for the housekeeper, I was consuming a
      morsel of an ancient metrical romance. After waiting for some time, I
      glanced towards the door, for I had begun to get impatient for the
      entrance of my helper. To my surprise, there stood Lady Alice, her eyes
      fixed upon me with an expression I could not comprehend. Her face
      instantly altered to its usual look of indifference, dashed with the least
      possible degree of scorn, as she turned and walked slowly away. I rose
      involuntarily. An old cavalry sword, which I had just taken down from the
      wall, and had placed leaning against the books from which I now rose, fell
      with a clash to the floor. I started; for it was a sound that always
      startled me; and stooping I lifted the weapon. But what was my surprise
      when I raised my head, to see once more the face of Lady Alice staring in
      at the door! yet not the same face, for it had changed in the moment that
      had passed. It was pale with fear&mdash;not fright; and her great black
      eyes were staring beyond me as if she saw something through the wall of
      the room. Once more her face altered to the former scornful indifference,
      and she vanished. Keen of hearing as I was, I had never yet heard the
      footstep of Lady Alice.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. <i>The Somnambulist.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      One night I was sitting in my room, devouring an old romance which I had
      brought from the library. It was late. The fire blazed bright; but the
      candles were nearly burnt out, and I grew sleepy over the volume, romance
      as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I found myself on my feet, listening with an agony of intention.
      Whether I had heard anything I could not tell; but I felt as if I had.
      Yes; I was sure of it. Far away, somewhere in the labyrinthine pile, I
      heard a faint cry. Driven by some secret impulse, I flew, without a
      moment&rsquo;s reflection, to the closet door, lifted the tapestry within,
      unfastened the second door, and stood in the great waste echoing hall,
      amid the touches, light and ghostly, of the cobwebs set afloat in the
      eddies occasioned by my sudden entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faded moonbeam fell on the floor, and filled the place with an ancient
      dream-light, which wrought strangely on my brain, and filled it, as if it,
      too, were but a deserted, sleepy house, haunted by old dreams and
      memories. Recollecting myself, I went back for a light; but the candles
      were both flickering in the sockets, and I was compelled to trust to the
      moon. I ascended the staircase. Old as it was, not a board creaked, not a
      banister shook&mdash;the whole felt solid as rock. Finding, at length, no
      more stair to ascend, I groped my way on; for here there was no direct
      light from the moon&mdash;only the light of the moonlit air. I was in some
      trepidation, I confess; for how should I find my way back? But the worst
      result likely to ensue was, that I should have to spend the night without
      knowing where; for with the first glimmer of morning, I should be able to
      return to my room. At length, after wandering into several rooms and out
      again, my hand fell on a latched door. I opened it, and entered a long
      corridor, with many windows on one side. Broad strips of moonlight lay
      slantingly across the narrow floor, divided by regular intervals of shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started, and my heart swelled; for I saw a movement somewhere&mdash;I
      could neither tell where, nor of what: I was only aware of motion. I stood
      in the first shadow, and gazed, but saw nothing. I sped across the light
      to the next shadow, and stood again, looking with fearful fixedness of
      gaze towards the far end of the corridor. Suddenly a white form glimmered
      and vanished. I crossed to the next shadow. Again a glimmer and vanishing,
      but nearer. Nerving myself to the utmost, I ceased the stealthiness of my
      movements, and went forward, slowly and steadily. A tall form, apparently
      of a woman, dressed in a long white robe, appeared in one of the streams
      of light, threw its arms over its head, gave a wild cry&mdash;which,
      notwithstanding its wildness and force, had a muffled sound, as if many
      folds, either of matter or of space, intervened&mdash;and fell at full
      length along the moonlight. Amidst the thrill of agony which shook me at
      the cry, I rushed forward, and, kneeling beside the prostrate figure,
      discovered that, unearthly as was the scream which had preceded her fall,
      it was the Lady Alice. I saw the fact in a moment: the Lady Alice was a
      somnambulist. Startled by the noise of my advance, she had awaked; and the
      usual terror and fainting had followed. She was cold and motionless as
      death. What was to be done? If I called, the probability was that no one
      would hear me; or if any one should hear&mdash;but I need not follow the
      course of my thought, as I tried in vain to recover the poor girl. Suffice
      it to say, that both for her sake and my own, I could not face the chance
      of being found, in the dead of night, by common-minded domestics, in such
      a situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was kneeling by her side, not knowing what to do, when a horror, as from
      the presence of death suddenly recognized, fell upon me. I thought she
      must be dead. But at the same moment, I hear, or seemed to hear, (how
      should I know which?) the rapid gallop of a horse, and the clank of a
      loose shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an agony of fear, I caught her up in my arms, and, carrying her on my
      arms, as one carries a sleeping child, hurried back through the corridor.
      Her hair, which was loose, trailed on the ground; and, as I fled, I
      trampled on it and stumbled. She moaned; and that instant the gallop
      ceased. I lifted her up across my shoulder, and carried her more easily.
      How I found my way to the stair I cannot tell: I know that I groped about
      for some time, like one in a dream with a ghost in his arms. At last I
      reached it, and descending, crossed the hall, and entered my room. There I
      placed Lady Alice upon an old couch, secured the doors, and began to
      breathe&mdash;and think. The first thing was to get her warm, for she was
      cold as the dead. I covered her with my plaid and my dressing-gown, pulled
      the couch before the fire, and considered what to do next.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. <i>The First Waking</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While I hesitated, Nature had her own way, and, with a deep-drawn sigh,
      Lady Alice opened her eyes. Never shall I forget the look of mingled
      bewilderment, alarm, and shame, with which her great eyes met mine. But,
      in a moment, this expression changed to that of anger. Her dark eyes
      flashed with light; and a cloud of roseate wrath grew in her face, till it
      glowed with the opaque red of a camellia. She had almost started from the
      couch, when, apparently discovering the unsuitableness of her dress, she
      checked her impetuosity, and remained leaning on her elbow. Overcome by
      her anger, her beauty, and my own confusion, I knelt before her, unable to
      speak, or to withdraw my eyes from hers. After a moment&rsquo;s pause, she began
      to question me like a queen, and I to reply like a culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did I come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I carried you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you find me, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lip curled with ten times the usual scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the old house, in a long corridor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right had you to be there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard a cry, and could not help going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis impossible.&mdash;I see. Some wretch told you, and you watched for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not, Lady Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst into tears, and fell back on the couch, with her face turned
      away. Then, anger reviving, she went on through her sobs:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not leave me where I fell? You had done enough to hurt me
      without bringing me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again she fell a-weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I found words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Alice,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how could I leave you lying in the moonlight?
      Before the sun rose, the terrible moon might have distorted your beautiful
      face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent, sir. What have you to do with my face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the wind, Lady Alice, was blowing through the corridor windows, keen
      and cold as the moonlight. How could I leave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could have called for help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Lady Alice, if I erred in thinking you would rather command
      the silence of a gentleman to whom an accident had revealed your secret,
      than be exposed to the domestics who would have gathered round us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she half raised herself, and again her eyes flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A secret with <i>you</i>, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, besides, Lady Alice,&rdquo; I cried, springing to my feet, in distress at
      her hardness, &ldquo;I heard the horse with the clanking shoe, and, in terror, I
      caught you up, and fled with you, almost before I knew what I did. And I
      hear it now&mdash;I hear it now!&rdquo; I cried, as once more the ominous sound
      rang through my brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angry glow faded from her face, and its paleness grew almost ghastly
      with dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> hear it?&rdquo; she said, throwing back her covering, and rising
      from the couch. &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood listening with distended eyes, as if <i>they</i> were the gates
      by which such sounds entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not hear it,&rdquo; she said again, after a pause. &ldquo;It must be gone now.&rdquo;
       Then, turning to me, she laid her hand on my arm, and looked at me. Her
      black hair, disordered and entangled, wandered all over her white dress to
      her knees. Her face was paler than ever; and her eyes were so wide open
      that I could see the white all round the large dark iris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No one ever heard it before but me. I must
      forgive you&mdash;you could not help it. I will trust you, too. Take me to
      my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word of reply, I wrapped my plaid about her. Then bethinking me
      of my chamber-candle, I lighted it, and opening the two doors, led her out
      of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why do you take me this way? I do not know the
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the way I brought you in, Lady Alice,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I know no
      other way to the spot where I found you. And I can guide you no farther
      than there&mdash;hardly even so far, for I groped my way there for the
      first time this night or morning&mdash;whichever it may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is past midnight, but not morning yet,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I always know.
      But there must be another way from your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course; but we should have to pass the housekeeper&rsquo;s door&mdash;she
      is always late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we near her room? I should know my way from there. I fear it would
      not surprise any of the household to see me. They would say&mdash;&lsquo;It is
      only Lady Alice.&rsquo; Yet I cannot tell you how I shrink from being seen. No&mdash;I
      will try the way you brought me&mdash;if you do not mind going back with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation passed in low tone and hurried words. It was scarcely
      over before we found ourselves at the foot of the staircase. Lady Alice
      shivered, and drew the plaid close round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ascended, and soon found the corridor; but when we got through it, she
      was rather bewildered. At length, after looking into several of the rooms,
      empty all, except for stray articles of ancient furniture, she exclaimed,
      as she entered one, and, taking the candle from my hand, held it above her
      head&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! I am right at last. This is the haunted room. I know my way
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught a darkling glimpse of a large room, apparently quite furnished;
      but how, except from the general feeling of antiquity and mustiness, I
      could not tell. Little did I think then what memories&mdash;old, now, like
      the ghosts that with them haunt the place&mdash;would ere long find their
      being and take their abode in that ancient room, to forsake it never more.
      In strange, half-waking moods, I seem to see the ghosts and the memories
      flitting together through the spectral moonlight, and weaving mystic
      dances in and out of the storied windows and the tapestried walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of this room she said, &ldquo;I must leave you here. I will put down
      the light a little further on, and you can come for it. I owe you many
      thanks. You will not be afraid of being left so near the haunted room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured her that at present I felt strong enough to meet all the ghosts
      in or out of Hades. Turning, she smiled a sad, sweet smile, then went on a
      few paces, and disappeared. The light, however, remained; and I found the
      candle, with my plaid, deposited at the foot of a short flight of steps,
      at right angles to the passage she left me in. I made my way back to my
      room, threw myself on the couch on which she had so lately lain, and
      neither went to bed nor slept that night. Before the morning, I had fully
      entered that phase of individual development commonly called <i>love</i>,
      of which the real nature is as great a mystery to me now, as it was at any
      period previous to its evolution in myself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. <i>Love and Power</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the morning came, I began to doubt whether my wakefulness had not
      been part of my dream, and I had not dreamed the whole of my supposed
      adventures. There was no sign of a lady&rsquo;s presence left in the room.&mdash;How
      could there have been?&mdash;But throwing the plaid which covered me
      aside, my hand was caught by a single thread of something so fine that I
      could not see it till the light grew strong. I wound it round and round my
      finger, and doubted no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast there was no Lady Alice&mdash;nor at dinner. I grew uneasy,
      but what could I do? I soon learned that she was ill; and a weary
      fortnight passed before I saw her again. Mrs. Wilson told me that she had
      caught cold, and was confined to her room. So I was ill at ease, not from
      love alone, but from anxiety as well. Every night I crept up through the
      deserted house to the stair where she had vanished, and there sat in the
      darkness or groped and peered about for some sign. But I saw no light
      even, and did not know where her room was. It might be far beyond this
      extremity of my knowledge; for I discovered no indication of the proximity
      of the inhabited portion of the house. Mrs. Wilson said there was nothing
      serious the matter; but this did not satisfy me, for I imagined something
      mysterious in the way in which she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days went on, and she did not appear, my soul began to droop within
      me; my intellect seemed about to desert me altogether. In vain I tried to
      read. Nothing could fix my attention. I read and re-read the same page;
      but although I understood every word as I read, I found when I came to a
      pause, that there lingered in my mind no palest notion of the idea. It was
      just what one experiences in attempting to read when half-asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried Euclid, and fared a little better with that. But having now to
      initiate my boys into the mysteries of equations, I soon found that
      although I could manage a very simple one, yet when I attempted one more
      complex&mdash;one in which something bordering upon imagination was
      necessary to find out the object for which to appoint the symbol to handle
      it by&mdash;the necessary power of concentration was itself a missing
      factor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although my thoughts were thus beyond my control, my duties were not
      altogether irksome to me. I remembered that they kept me near her; and
      although I could not learn, I found that I could teach a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it is foolish to dwell upon an individual variety of an almost
      universal stage in the fever of life; but one exception to these
      indications of mental paralysis I think worth mentioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continued my work in the library, although it did not advance with the
      same steadiness as before. One day, in listless mood, I took up a volume,
      without knowing what it was, or what I sought. It opened at the <i>Amoretti</i>
      of Edmund Spenser. I was on the point of closing it again, when a line
      caught my eye. I read the sonnet; read another; found I could understand
      them perfectly; and that hour the poetry of the sixteenth century,
      hitherto a sealed fountain, became an open well of refreshment, and the
      strength that comes from sympathy. What if its second-rate writers were
      full of conceits and vagaries, the feelings are very indifferent to the
      mere intellectual forms around which the same feelings in others have
      gathered, if only by their means they hint at, and sometimes express
      themselves. Now I understood this old fantastic verse, and knew that the
      foam-bells on the torrent of passionate feeling are iris-hued. And what
      was more&mdash;it proved an intellectual nexus between my love and my
      studies, or at least a bridge by which I could pass from the one to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same day, I remember well, Mrs. Wilson told me that Lady Alice was
      much better. But as days passed, and still she did not make her
      appearance, my anxiety only changed its object, and I feared that it was
      from aversion to me that she did not join the family. But her name was
      never mentioned in my hearing by any of the other members of it; and her
      absence appeared to be to them a matter of no moment or interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, as I sat in my room, I found, as usual, that it was impossible
      to read; and throwing the book aside, relapsed into that sphere of thought
      which now filled my soul, and had for its centre the Lady Alice. I
      recalled her form as she lay on the couch, and brooded over the
      remembrance till a longing to see her, almost unbearable, arose within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to heaven,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;that will were power!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this concurrence of idleness, distraction, and vehement desire, I found
      all at once, without any foregone resolution, that I was concentrating and
      intensifying within me, until it rose almost to a command, the operative
      volition that Lady Alice should come to me. In a moment more I trembled at
      the sense of a new power which sprang into conscious being within me. I
      had had no prevision of its existence, when I gave way to such extravagant
      and apparently helpless wishes. I now actually awaited the fulfilment of
      my desire; but in a condition ill-fitted to receive it, for the effort had
      already exhausted me to such a degree, that every nerve was in a conscious
      tremor. Nor had I long to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard no sound of approach: the closet-door folded back, and in glided,
      open-eyed, but sightless pale as death, and clad in white, ghostly-pure
      and saint-like, the Lady Alice. I shuddered from head to foot at what I
      had done. She was more terrible to me in that moment than any pale-eyed
      ghost could have been. For had I not exercised a kind of necromantic art,
      and roused without awaking the slumbering dead? She passed me, walking
      round the table at which I was seated, went to the couch, laid herself
      down with a maidenly care, turned a little on one side, with her face
      towards me, and gradually closed her eyes. In something deeper than sleep
      she lay, and yet not in death. I rose, and once more knelt beside her, but
      dared not touch her. In what far realms of life might the lovely soul be
      straying! What mysterious modes of being might now be the homely
      surroundings of her second life! Thoughts unutterable rose in me,
      culminated, and sank, like the stars of heaven, as I gazed on the present
      symbol of an absent life&mdash;a life that I loved by means of the symbol;
      a symbol that I loved because of the life. How long she lay thus, how long
      I gazed upon her thus, I do not know. Gradually, but without my being able
      to distinguish the gradations, her countenance altered to that of one who
      sleeps. But the change did not end there. A colour, faint as the blush in
      the centre of a white rose, tinged her lips, and deepened; then her cheek
      began to share in the hue, then her brow and her neck. The colour was that
      of the cloud which, the farthest from the sunset, yet acknowledges the
      rosy atmosphere. I watched, as it were, the dawn of a soul on the horizon
      of the visible. The first approaches of its far-off flight were manifest;
      and as I watched, I saw it come nearer and nearer, till its great, silent,
      speeding pinions were folded, and it looked forth, a calm, beautiful,
      infinite woman, from the face and form sleeping before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that she was awake, some moments before she opened her eyes. When
      at last those depths of darkness disclosed themselves, slowly uplifting
      their white cloudy portals, the same consternation she had formerly
      manifested, accompanied by yet greater anger, followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet again! Am I your slave, because I am weak?&rdquo; She rose in the majesty
      of wrath, and moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Alice, I have not touched you. I am to blame, but not as you think.
      Could I help longing to see you? And if the longing passed, ere I was
      aware, into a will that you should come, and you obeyed it, forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hid my face in my hands, overcome by conflicting emotions. A kind of
      stupor came over me. When I lifted my head, she was standing by the
      closet-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have waited,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to make a request of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not utter it, Lady Alice. I know what it is. I give you my word&mdash;my
      solemn promise, if you like&mdash;that I will never do it again.&rdquo; She
      thanked me, with a smile, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much to my surprise, she appeared at dinner next day. No notice was taken
      of her, except by the younger of my pupils, who called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Alice! Are you down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and nodded, but did not speak. Everything went on as usual.
      There was no change in her behaviour, except in one point. I ventured the
      experiment of paying her some ordinary enough attention. She thanked me,
      without a trace of the scornful expression I all but expected to see upon
      her beautiful face. But when I addressed her about the weather, or
      something equally interesting, she made no reply; and Lady Hilton gave me
      a stare, as much as to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s of no use to talk to
      her?&rdquo; Alice saw the look, and colouring to the eyes, rose, and left the
      room. When she had gone, Lady Hilton said to me,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to her, Mr. Campbell&mdash;it distresses her. She is very
      peculiar, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not hide the scorn and dislike with which she spoke; and I could
      not help saying to myself, &ldquo;What a different thing scorn looks on <i>your</i>
      face, Lady Hilton!&rdquo; for it made her positively and hatefully ugly for the
      moment&mdash;to my eyes, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, Alice sat down with us at all our meals, and seemed tolerably
      well. But, in some indescribable way, she was quite a different person
      from the Lady Alice who had twice awaked in my presence. To use a phrase
      common in describing one of weak intellect&mdash;she never seemed to be
      all there. There was something automatical in her movements; and a sort of
      frozen indifference was the prevailing expression of her countenance. When
      she smiled, a sweet light shone in her eyes, and she looked for the moment
      like the Lady Alice of my nightly dreams. But, altogether, the Lady Alice
      of the night, and the Lady Alice of the day, were two distinct persons. I
      believed that the former was the real one.
    </p>
    <p>
      What nights I had now, watching and striving lest unawares I should fall
      into the exercise of my new power! I allowed myself to think of her as
      much as I pleased in the daytime, or at least as much as I dared; for when
      occupied with my pupils, I dreaded lest any abstraction should even hint
      that I had a thought to conceal. I knew that I could not hurt her then;
      for that only in the night did she enter that state of existence in which
      my will could exercise authority over her. But at night&mdash;at night&mdash;when
      I knew she lay there, and might be lying here; when but a thought would
      bring her, and that thought was fluttering its wings, ready to spring
      awake out of the dreams of my heart&mdash;then the struggle was fearful.
      And what added force to the temptation was, that to call her to me in the
      night, seemed like calling the real immortal Alice forth from the tomb in
      which she wandered about all day. It was as painful to me to see her such
      in the day, as it was entracing to remember her such as I had seen her in
      the night. What matter if her true self came forth in anger against me?
      What was I? It was enough for my life, I said, to look on her, such as she
      really was. &ldquo;Bring her yet once, and tell her all&mdash;tell her how
      madly, hopelessly you love her. She will forgive you at least,&rdquo; said a
      voice within me. But I heard it as the voice of the tempter, and kept down
      the thought which might have grown to the will.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. <i>A New Pupil</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day, exactly three weeks after her last visit to my room, as I was
      sitting with my three pupils in the schoolroom, Lady Alice entered, and
      began to look on the bookshelves as if she wanted some volume. After a few
      moments, she turned, and, approaching the table, said to me, in an abrupt,
      yet hesitating way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Campbell, I cannot spell. How am I to learn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought for a moment, and replied: &ldquo;Copy a passage every day, Lady
      Alice, from some favourite book. Then, if you allow me, I shall be most
      happy to point out any mistakes you may have made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Campbell, I will; but I am afraid you will despise me,
      when you find how badly I spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no fear of that,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;It is a mere peculiarity. So long
      as one can <i>think</i> well, spelling is altogether secondary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I will try,&rdquo; she said, and left the room. Next day, she
      brought me an old ballad, written tolerably, but in a school-girl&rsquo;s hand.
      She had copied the antique spelling, letter for letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is quite correct,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but to copy such as this will not teach
      you properly; for it is very old, and consequently old-fashioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it old? Don&rsquo;t we spell like that now? You see I do not know anything
      about it. You must set me a task, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I undertook with more pleasure than I dared to show. Every day she
      brought me the appointed exercise, written with a steadily improving hand.
      To my surprise, I never found a single error in the spelling. Of course,
      when, advancing a step in the process, I made her write from my dictation,
      she did make blunders, but not so many as I had expected; and she seldom
      repeated one after correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new association gave me many opportunities of doing more for her than
      merely teaching her to spell. We talked about what she copied; and I had
      to explain. I also told her about the writers. Soon she expressed a desire
      to know something of figures. We commenced arithmetic. I proposed geometry
      along with it, and found the latter especially fitted to her powers. One
      by one we included several other necessary branches; and ere long I had
      four around the schoolroom table&mdash;equally my pupils. Whether the
      attempts previously made to instruct her had been insufficient or
      misdirected, or whether her intellectual powers had commenced a fresh
      growth, I could not tell; but I leaned to the latter conclusion,
      especially after I began to observe that her peculiar remarks had become
      modified in form, though without losing any of their originality. The
      unearthliness of her beauty likewise disappeared, a slight colour
      displacing the almost marbly whiteness of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before Lady Alice had made this progress, my nightly struggles began
      to diminish in violence. They had now entirely ceased. The temptation had
      left me. I felt certain that for weeks she had never walked in her sleep.
      She was beyond my power, and I was glad of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was, of course, most careful of my behaviour during all this period. I
      strove to pay Lady Alice no more attention than I paid to the rest of my
      pupils; and I cannot help thinking that I succeeded. But now and then, in
      the midst of some instruction I was giving Lady Alice, I caught the eye of
      Lady Lucy, a sharp, common-minded girl, fixed upon one or the other of us,
      with an inquisitive vulgar expression, which I did not like. This made me
      more careful still. I watched my tones, to keep them even, and free from
      any expression of the feeling of which my heart was full. Sometimes,
      however, I could not help revealing the gratification I felt when she made
      some marvellous remark&mdash;marvellous, I mean, in relation to her other
      attainments; such a remark as a child will sometimes make, showing that he
      has already mastered, through his earnest simplicity, some question that
      has for ages perplexed the wise and the prudent. On one of these
      occasions, I found the cat eyes of Lady Lucy glittering on me. I turned
      away; not, I fear, without showing some displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was from Lady Lucy&rsquo;s evil report, or that the change in Lady
      Alice&rsquo;s habits and appearance had attracted the attention of Lady Hilton,
      I cannot tell; but one morning she appeared at the door of the study, and
      called her. Lady Alice rose and went, with a slight gesture of impatience.
      In a few minutes she returned, looking angry and determined, and resumed
      her seat. But whatever it was that had passed between them, it had
      destroyed that quiet flow of the feelings which was necessary to the
      working of her thoughts. In vain she tried: she could do nothing
      correctly. At last she burst into tears and left the room. I was almost
      beside myself with distress and apprehension. She did not return that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning she entered at the usual hour, looking composed, but paler
      than of late, and showing signs of recent weeping. When we were all
      seated, and had just commenced our work, I happened to look up, and caught
      her eyes intently fixed on me. They dropped instantly, but without any
      appearance of confusion. She went on with her arithmetic, and succeeded
      tolerably. But this respite was to be of short duration. Lady Hilton again
      entered, and called her. She rose angrily, and my quick ear caught the
      half-uttered words, &ldquo;That woman will make an idiot of me again!&rdquo; She did
      not return; and never from that hour resumed her place in the schoolroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time passed heavily. At dinner she looked proud and constrained; and
      spoke only in monosyllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days I scarcely saw her. But the third day, as I was busy in the
      library alone, she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help you, Mr. Campbell?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced involuntarily towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Hilton is not at home,&rdquo; she replied to my look, while a curl of
      indignation contended with a sweet tremor of shame for the possession of
      her lip.&mdash;&ldquo;Let me help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will help me best if you sing that ballad I heard you singing just
      before you came in. I never heard you sing before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you? I don&rsquo;t think I ever did sing before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing it again, will you, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only two verses. My old Scotch nurse used to sing it when I was a
      little girl-oh, so long ago! I didn&rsquo;t know I could sing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began without more ado, standing in the middle of the room, with her
      back towards the door.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Annie was dowie, an&rsquo; Willie was wae:
  What can be the matter wi&rsquo; siccan a twae?
  For Annie was bonnie&rsquo;s the first o&rsquo; the day,
  And Willie was strang an&rsquo; honest an&rsquo; gay.

  Oh! the tane had a daddy was poor an&rsquo; was proud;
  An&rsquo; the tither a minnie that cared for the gowd.
  They lo&rsquo;ed are anither, an&rsquo; said their say&mdash;
  But the daddy an&rsquo; minnie hae pairtit the twae.
</pre>
    <p>
      Just as she finished the song, I saw the sharp eyes of Lady Lucy peeping
      in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Lucy is watching at the door, Lady Alice,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she answered; but turned with a flush on her face, and
      stepped noiselessly to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one there,&rdquo; she said, returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was, though,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want to drive me mad,&rdquo; she cried, and hurried from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day but one, she came again with the same request. But she had
      not been a minute in the library before Lady Hilton came to the door and
      called her in angry tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; replied Alice, and remained where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go, Lady Alice,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;They will send me away if you refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed scarlet, and went without another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came no more to the library.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. <i>Confession</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Day followed day, the one the child of the other. Alice&rsquo;s old paleness and
      unearthly look began to reappear; and, strange to tell, my midnight
      temptation revived. After a time she ceased to dine with us again, and for
      days I never saw her. It was the old story of suffering with me, only more
      intense than before. The day was dreary, and the night stormy. &ldquo;Call her,&rdquo;
       said my heart; but my conscience resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was lying on the floor of my room one midnight, with my face to the
      ground, when suddenly I heard a low, sweet, strange voice singing
      somewhere. The moment I became aware that I heard it I felt as if I had
      been listening to it unconsciously for some minutes past. I lay still,
      either charmed to stillness, or fearful of breaking the spell. As I lay, I
      was lapt in the folds of a waking dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in bed in a castle, on the seashore; the wind came from the sea in
      chill <i>eerie soughs</i>, and the waves fell with a threatful tone upon
      the beach, muttering many maledictions as they rushed up, and whispering
      cruel portents as they drew back, hissing and gurgling, through the
      million narrow ways of the pebbly ramparts; and I knew that a maiden in
      white was standing in the cold wind, by the angry sea, singing. I had a
      kind of dreamy belief in my dream; but, overpowered by the spell of the
      music, I still lay and listened. Keener and stronger, under the impulses
      of my will, grew the power of my hearing. At last I could distinguish the
      words. The ballad was <i>Annie of Lochroyan;</i> and Lady Alice was
      singing it. The words I heard were these:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Oh, gin I had a bonnie ship,
  And men to sail wi&rsquo; me,
  It&rsquo;s I wad gang to my true love,
  Sin&rsquo; he winna come to me.

  Lang stood she at her true love&rsquo;s door,
  And lang tirled at the pin;
  At length up gat his fause mother,
  Says, &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s that wad be in?&rdquo;
 
</pre>
    <hr />
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Love Gregory started frae his sleep,
  And to his mother did say:
  &ldquo;I dreamed a dream this night, mither,
  That maks my heart right wae.

  &ldquo;I dreamed that Annie of Lochroyan,
  The flower of a&rsquo; her kin,
  Was standing mournin&rsquo; at my door,
  But nane wad let her in.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I sprang to my feet, and opened the hidden door. There she stood, white,
      asleep, with closed eyes, singing like a bird, only with a heartful of sad
      meaning in every tone. I stepped aside, without speaking, and she passed
      me into the room. I closed the door, and followed her. She lay already
      upon the couch, still and restful&mdash;already covered with my plaid. I
      sat down beside her, waiting; and gazed upon her in wonderment. That she
      was possessed of very superior intellectual powers, whatever might be the
      cause of their having lain dormant so long, I had already fully convinced
      myself; but I was not prepared to find art as well as intellect. I had
      already heard her sing the little song of two verses, which she had
      learned from her nurse. But here was a song, of her own making as to the
      music, so true and so potent, that, before I knew anything of the words,
      it had surrounded me with a dream of the place in which the scene of the
      ballad was laid. It did not then occur to me that, perhaps, our
      idiosyncrasies were such as not to require even the music of the ballad
      for the production of <i>rapport</i> between our minds, the brain of the
      one generating in the brain of the other the vision present to itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat and thought:&mdash;Some obstruction in the gateways, outward,
      prevented her, in her waking hours, from uttering herself at all. This
      obstruction, damming back upon their sources the out-goings of life, threw
      her into this abnormal sleep. In it the impulse to utterance, still
      unsatisfied, so wrought within her unable, yet compliant form, that she
      could not rest, but rose and walked. And now, a fresh surge from the sea
      of her unknown being, unrepressed by the <i>hitherto</i> of the objects of
      sense, had burst the gates and bars, swept the obstructions from its
      channel, and poured from her in melodious song.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first green lobes, at least, of these thoughts, appeared above the
      soil of my mind, while I sat and gazed on the sleeping girl. And now I had
      once more the delight of watching a spirit-dawn, a soul-rise, in that
      lovely form. The light flushing of its pallid sky was, as before, the
      first sign. I dreaded the flash of lovely flame, and the outburst of
      regnant anger, ere I should have time to say that I was not to blame. But
      when, at length, the full dawn, the slow sunrise came, it was with all the
      gentleness of a cloudy summer morn. Never did a more celestial rosy red
      hang about the skirts of the level sun, than deepened and glowed upon her
      face, when, opening her eyes, she saw me beside her. She covered her face
      with her hands; and instead of the words of indignant reproach which I
      dreaded to hear, she murmured behind the snowy screen: &ldquo;I am glad you have
      broken your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart gave a bound and was still. I grew faint with delight. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I
      said; &ldquo;I have not broken my promise, Lady Alice; I have struggled nearly
      to madness to keep it&mdash;and I have kept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come then of myself. Worse and worse! But it is their fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears now found their way through the repressing fingers. I could not
      endure to see her weep. I knelt beside her, and, while she still covered
      her face with her hands, I said&mdash;I do not know what I said. They were
      wild, and, doubtless, foolish words in themselves, but they must have been
      wise and true in their meaning. When I ceased, I knew that I had ceased
      only by the great silence around me. I was still looking at her hands.
      Slowly she withdrew them. It was as when the sun breaks forth on a cloudy
      day. The winter was over and gone; the time of the singing of birds had
      come. She smiled on me through her tears, and heart met heart in the light
      of that smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to go at once, and I begged for no delay. I only stood with
      clasped hands, gazing at her. She turned at the door, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay I shall come again; I am afraid I cannot help it; only mind you
      do not wake me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could reply, I was alone; and I felt that I must not follow her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. <i>Questioning</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I laid myself on the couch she had left, but not to sleep. A new pulse of
      life, stronger than I could bear, was throbbing within me. I dreaded a
      fever, lest I should talk in it, and drop the clue to my secret treasure.
      But the light of the morning stilled me, and a bath in ice-cold water made
      me strong again. Yet I felt all that day as if I were dying a delicious
      death, and going to a yet more exquisite life. As far as I might, however,
      I repressed all indications of my delight; and endeavoured, for the sake
      both of duty and of prudence, to be as attentive to my pupils and their
      studies as it was possible for man to be. This helped to keep me in my
      right mind. But, more than all my efforts at composure, the pain which, as
      far as my experience goes, invariably accompanies, and sometimes even
      usurps, the place of the pleasure which gave it birth, was efficacious in
      keeping me sane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night came, but brought no Lady Alice. It was a week before I saw her
      again. Her heart had been stilled, and she was able to sleep aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      But seven nights after, she did come. I waited her awaking, possessed with
      one painful thought, which I longed to impart to her. She awoke with a
      smile, covered her face for a moment, but only for a moment, and then sat
      up. I stood before her; and the first words I spoke were:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Alice, ought I not to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied at once. &ldquo;I can claim some compensation from them for
      the wrong they have been doing me. Do you know in what relation I stand to
      Lord and Lady Hilton? They are but my stepmother and her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have a fortune of my own, about which I never thought or cared&mdash;till&mdash;till&mdash;within
      the last few weeks. Lord Hilton is my guardian. Whether they made me the
      stupid creature I <i>was,</i> I do not know; but I believe they have
      represented me as far worse than I was, to keep people from making my
      acquaintance. They prevented my going on with my lessons, because they saw
      I was getting to understand things, and grow like other people; and that
      would not suit their purposes. It would be false delicacy in you to leave
      me to them, when you can make up to me for their injustice. Their
      behaviour to me takes away any right they had over me, and frees you from
      any obligation, because I am yours.&mdash;Am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more she covered her face with her hands. I could answer only by
      withdrawing one of them, which I <i>was</i> now emboldened to keep in my
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was very willingly persuaded to what was so much my own desire. But
      whether the reasoning was quite just or not, I am not yet sure. Perhaps it
      might be so for her, and yet not for me: I do not know; I am a poor
      casuist.
    </p>
    <p>
      She resumed, laying her other hand upon mine:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be to tell the soul which you have called forth, to go back into
      its dark moaning cavern, and never more come out to the light of day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How could I resist this?
    </p>
    <p>
      A long pause ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; she said, at length, &ldquo;to feel, when I lie down at night,
      that I may awake in your presence, without knowing how. It is strange,
      too, that, although I should be utterly ashamed to come wittingly, I feel
      no confusion when I find myself here. When I feel myself coming awake, I
      lie for a little while with my eyes closed, wondering and hoping, and
      afraid to open them, lest I should find myself only in my own chamber;
      shrinking a little, too&mdash;just a little&mdash;from the first glance
      into your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when you awake, do you know nothing of what has taken place in your
      sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no vague sensations, no haunting shadows, no dim ghostly moods,
      seeming to belong to that condition, left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, said &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; and left me.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. <i>Jealousy.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Again seven days passed before she revisited me. Indeed, her visits had
      always an interval of seven days, or a multiple of seven, between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the last, a maddening jealousy had seized me. For, returning from
      those unknown regions into which her soul had wandered away, and where she
      had stayed for hours, did she not sometimes awake with a smile? How could
      I be sure that she did not lead two distinct existences?&mdash;that she
      had not some loving spirit, or man, who, like her, had for a time left the
      body behind&mdash;who was all in all to her in that region, and whom she
      forgot when she forsook it, as she forgot me when she entered it? It was a
      thought I could not brook. But I put aside its persistency as well as I
      could, till she should come again. For this I waited. I could not now
      endure the thought of compelling the attendance of her unconscious form;
      of making her body, like a living cage, transport to my presence the
      unresisting soul. I shrank from it as a true man would shrink from kissing
      the lips of a sleeping woman whom he loved, not knowing that she loved him
      in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may well be said that to follow such a doubt was to inquire too
      curiously; but once the thought had begun, and grown, and been born, how
      was I to slay the monster, and be free of its hated presence? Was its
      truth not a possibility?&mdash;Yet how could even she help me, for she
      knew nothing of the matter? How could she vouch for the unknown? What news
      can the serene face of the moon, ever the same to us, give of the hidden
      half of herself turned ever towards what seems to us but the blind abysmal
      darkness, which yet has its own light and its own life? All I could hope
      for was to see her, to tell her, to be comforted at least by her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      My saving angel glided blind into my room, lay down upon her bier, and
      awaited the resurrection. I sat and awaited mine, panting to untwine from
      my heart the cold death-worm that twisted around it, yet picturing to
      myself the glow of love on the averted face of the beautiful spirit&mdash;averted
      from me, and bending on a radiant companion all the light withdrawn from
      the lovely form beside me. That light began to return. &ldquo;She is coming, she
      is coming,&rdquo; I said within me. &ldquo;Back from its glowing south travels the sun
      of my spring, the glory of my summer.&rdquo; Floating slowly up from the
      infinite depths of her being, came the conscious woman; up&mdash;up from
      the realms of stillness lying deeper than the plummet of self-knowledge
      can sound; up from the formless, up into the known, up into the material,
      up to the windows that look forth on the embodied mysteries around. Her
      eyelids rose. One look of love all but slew my fear. When I told her my
      grief, she answered with a smile of pity, yet half of disdain at the
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever I find it so, I will kill myself there, that I may go to my Hades
      with you. But if I am dreaming of another, how is it that I always rise in
      my vision and come to you? You will go crazy if you fancy such foolish
      things,&rdquo; she added, with a smile of reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectral thought vanished, and I was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you,&rdquo; she resumed, covering her face with her hands, &ldquo;why I
      behaved so proudly to you, from the very first day you entered the house?
      It was because, when I passed you on the lawn, before ever you entered the
      house, I felt a strange, undefinable attraction towards you, which
      continued, although I could not account for it and would not yield to it.
      I was heartily annoyed at it. But you see it was of no use&mdash;here I
      am. That was what made me so fierce, too, when I first found myself in
      your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed long before she came to my room again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. <i>The Chamber of Ghosts</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But now she returned once more into the usual routine of the family. I
      fear I was unable to repress all signs of agitation when, next day, she
      entered the dining-room, after we were seated, and took her customary
      place at the table. Her behaviour was much the same as before; but her
      face was very different. There was light in it now, and signs of mental
      movement. The smooth forehead would be occasionally wrinkled, and she
      would fall into moods which were evidently not of inanity, but of
      abstracted thought. She took especial care that our eyes should not meet.
      If by chance they did, instead of sinking hers, she kept them steady, and
      opened them wider, as if she was fixing them on nothing at all, or she
      raised them still higher, as if she was looking at something above me,
      before she allowed them to fall. But the change in her altogether was such
      that it must have attracted the notice and roused the speculation of Lady
      Hilton at least. For me, so well did she act her part, that I was thrown
      into perplexity by it. And when day after day passed, and the longing to
      speak to her grew, and remained unsatisfied, new doubts arose. Perhaps she
      was tired of me. Perhaps her new studies filled her mind with the clear,
      gladsome morning light of the pure intellect, which always throws doubt
      and distrust and a kind of negation upon the moonlight of passion,
      mysterious, and mingled ever with faint shadows of pain. I walked as in an
      unresting sleep. Utterly as I loved her, I was yet alarmed and distressed
      to find how entirely my being had grown dependent upon her love; how
      little of individual, self-existing, self-upholding life, I seemed to have
      left; how little I cared for anything, save as I could associate it with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting late one night in my room. I had all but given up hope of
      her coming. I had, perhaps, deprived her of the somnambulic power. I was
      brooding over this possibility, when all at once I felt as if I were
      looking into the haunted room. It seemed to be lighted by the moon,
      shining through the stained windows. The feeling came and went suddenly,
      as such visions of places generally do; but this had an indescribable
      something about it more clear and real than such resurrections of the
      past, whether willed or unwilled, commonly possess; and a great longing
      seized me to look into the room once more. I rose with a sense of yielding
      to the irresistible, left the room, groped my way through the hall and up
      the oak staircase&mdash;I had never thought of taking a light with me&mdash;and
      entered the corridor. No sooner had I entered it, than the thought sprang
      up in my mind&mdash;&ldquo;What if she should be there!&rdquo; My heart stood still
      for a moment, like a wounded deer, and then bounded on, with a pang in
      every bound. The corridor was night itself, with a dim, bluish-grey light
      from the windows, sufficing to mark their own spaces. I stole through it,
      and, without erring once, went straight to the haunted chamber. The door
      stood half open. I entered, and was bewildered by the dim, mysterious,
      dreamy loveliness upon which I gazed. The moon shone full upon the
      windows, and a thousand coloured lights and shadows crossed and
      intertwined upon the walls and floor, all so soft, and mingling, and
      undefined, that the brain was filled as with a flickering dance of ghostly
      rainbows. But I had little time to think of these; for out of the only
      dark corner in the room came a white figure, flitting across the chaos of
      lights, bedewed, besprinkled, bespattered, as she passed, with their
      multitudinous colours. I was speechless, motionless, with something far
      beyond joy. With a low moan of delight, Lady Alice sank into my arms.
      Then, looking up, with a light laugh&mdash;&ldquo;The scales are turned, dear,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;You are in my power now; I brought you here. I thought I could,
      and I tried, for I wanted so much to see you&mdash;and you are come.&rdquo; She
      led me across the room to the place where she had been seated, and we sat
      side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had forgotten me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or had grown tired of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? That was unkind. You have made my heart so still, that, body and
      soul, I sleep at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then shall I never see you more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can meet here. This is the best place. No one dares come near the
      haunted room at night. We might even venture in the evening. Look, now,
      from where we are sitting, across the air, between the windows and the
      shadows on the floor. Do you see nothing moving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked, but could see nothing. She resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost fancy, sometimes, that what old stories say about this room may
      be true. I could fancy now that I see dim transparent forms in ancient
      armour, and in strange antique dresses, men and women, moving about,
      meeting, speaking, embracing, parting, coming and going. But I was never
      afraid of such beings. I am sure these would not, could not hurt us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the room was not really what it was well fitted to be&mdash;a
      rendezvous for the ghosts of the past&mdash;then either my imagination,
      becoming more active as she spoke, began to operate upon my brain, or her
      fancies were mysteriously communicated to me; for I was persuaded that I
      saw such dim undefined forms as she described, of a substance only denser
      than the moonlight, flitting, and floating about, between the windows and
      the illuminated floor. Could they have been coloured shadows thrown from
      the stained glass upon the fine dust with which the slightest motion in
      such an old and neglected room must fill its atmosphere? I did not think
      of that then, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could persuade myself that I, too, see them,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I cannot say
      that I am afraid of such beings any more than you&mdash;if only they will
      not speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she replied, with a lengthened, meaning utterance, expressing
      sympathy with what I said; &ldquo;I know what you mean. I, too, am afraid of
      hearing things. And that reminds me, I have never yet asked you about the
      galloping horse. I too hear sometimes the sound of a loose horse-shoe. It
      always betokens some evil to me; but I do not know what it means. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;that there is a connection between your family
      and mine, somewhere far back in their histories?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Is there? How glad I am! Then perhaps you and I are related, and that
      is how we are so much alike, and have power over each other, and hear the
      same things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I suppose that is how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can you account for that sound which we both hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you what my old foster-mother told me,&rdquo; I replied. And I
      began by narrating when and where I had first heard the sound; and then
      gave her, as nearly as I could, the legend which nurse had recounted to
      me. I did not tell her its association with the events of my birth, for I
      feared exciting her imagination too much. She listened to it very quietly,
      however, and when I came to a close, only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, we cannot tell how much of it is true, but there may be
      something in it. I have never heard anything of the sort, and I, too, have
      an old nurse. She is with me still. You shall see her some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you meet me here again soon?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you wish,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then to-morrow, at midnight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And we parted at the door of the haunted chamber. I watched the flickering
      with which her whiteness just set the darkness in motion, and nothing
      more, seeming to see it long after I knew she must have turned aside and
      descended the steps leading towards her own room. Then I turned and groped
      my way back to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      We often met after this in the haunted room. Indeed my spirit haunted it
      all day and all night long. And when we met amid the shadows, we were
      wrapped in the mantle of love, and from its folds looked out fearless on
      the ghostly world about us. Ghosts or none, they never annoyed us. Our
      love was a talisman, yea, an elixir of life, which made us equal to the
      twice-born,&mdash;the disembodied dead. And they were as a wall of fear
      about us, to keep far off the unfriendly foot and the prying eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the griefs that followed, I often thought with myself that I would
      gladly die for a thousand years, might I then awake for one night in the
      haunted chamber, a ghost, among the ghosts who crowded its stained
      moonbeams, and see my dead Alice smiling across the glimmering rays, and
      beckoning me to the old nook, she, too, having come awake out of the sleep
      of death, in the dream of the haunted chamber. &ldquo;Might we but sit there,&rdquo; I
      said, &ldquo;through the night, as of old, and love and comfort each other, till
      the moon go down, and the pale dawn, which is the night of the ghosts,
      begin to arise, then gladly would I go to sleep for another thousand
      years, in the hope that when I next became conscious of life, it might be
      in another such ghostly night, in the chamber of the ghosts.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. <i>The Clanking Shoe</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time passed. We began to feel very secure in that room, watched as it was
      by the sleepless sentry, Fear. One night I ventured to take a light with
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice to have a candle!&rdquo; she said as I entered. &ldquo;I hope they are all
      in bed, though. It will drive some of them into fits if they see the
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to show you something I found in the library to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened a book, and showed her a paper inside it, with some verses
      written on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose writing is that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, of course. As if I did not know your writing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you look at the date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Seventeen hundred and ninety-three.&lsquo;</i> You are making game of me,
      Duncan. But the paper does look yellow and old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it as you see it, in that book. It belonged to Lord Hilton&rsquo;s
      brother. The verses are a translation of part of the poem beside which
      they lie&mdash;one by Von Salis, who died shortly before that date at the
      bottom. I will read them to you, and then show you something else that is
      strange about them. The poem is called <i>Psyche&rsquo;s Sorrow.</i> Psyche
      means the soul, Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember. You told me about her before, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Psyche&rsquo;s sighing all her prison darkens;
  She is moaning for the far-off stars;
  Fearing, hoping, every sound she hearkens&mdash;
  Fate may now be breaking at her bars.

  Bound, fast bound, are Psyche&rsquo;s airy pinions:
  High her heart, her mourning soft and low&mdash;
  Knowing that in sultry pain&rsquo;s dominions
  Grow the palms that crown the victor&rsquo;s brow;

  That the empty hand the wreath encloses;
  Earth&rsquo;s cold winds but make the spirit brave;
  Knowing that the briars bear the roses,
  Golden flowers the waste deserted grave.

  In the cypress-shade her myrtle groweth;
  Much she loves, because she much hath borne;
  Love-led, through the darksome way she goeth&mdash;
  On to meet him in the breaking morn.

  She can bear&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here the translation ceases, you see; and then follows the date, with the
      words in German underneath it&mdash;&lsquo;How weary I am!&rsquo; Now what is strange,
      Alice, is, that this date is the very month and year in which I was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply to this with anything beyond a mere assent. Her mind was
      fixed on the poem itself. She began to talk about it, and I was surprised
      to find how thoroughly she entered into it and understood it. She seemed
      to have crowded the growth of a lifetime into the last few months. At
      length I told her how unhappy I had felt for some time, at remaining in
      Lord Hilton&rsquo;s house, as matters now were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must go,&rdquo; she said, quite quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This troubled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not mind it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I shall be very glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go with me?&rdquo; I asked, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not know what to say to this, for I had no money, and of course I
      should have none of my salary. She divined at once the cause of my
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a diamond bracelet in my room,&rdquo; she said, with a smile, &ldquo;and a few
      guineas besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall we get away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is easier. My old nurse, whom I mentioned to you before, lives at
      the lodge gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know her very well,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s not Scotch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed she is. But she has been with our family almost all her life. I
      often go to see her, and sometimes stay all night with her. You can get a
      carriage ready in the village, and neither of us will be missed before
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her in renewed surprise at the decision of her invention. She
      covered her face, as she seldom did now, but went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can go to London, where you will easily find something to do. Men
      always can there. And when I come of age&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice, how old are you?&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;when I think of it&mdash;how
      odd!&mdash;that&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the date on the paper&mdash;&ldquo;is the
      very month in which I too was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was too much surprised to interrupt her, and she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never think of my age without recalling one thing about my birth, which
      nurse often refers to. She was going up the stair to my mother&rsquo;s room,
      when she happened to notice a bright star, not far from the new moon. As
      she crossed the room with me in her arms, just after I was born, she saw
      the same star almost on the tip of the opposite horn. My mother died a
      week after. Who knows how different I might have been if she had lived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was long before I spoke. The awful and mysterious thoughts roused in my
      mind by the revelations of the day held me silent. At length I said, half
      thinking aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you and I, Alice, were born the same hour, and our mothers died
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Receiving no answer, I looked at her. She was fast asleep, and breathing
      gentle, full breaths. She had been sitting for some time with her head
      lying on my shoulder and my arm around her. I could not bear to wake her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been in this position perhaps for half an hour, when suddenly a
      cold shiver ran through me, and all at once I became aware of the far-off
      gallop of a horse. It drew nearer. On and on it came&mdash;nearer and
      nearer. Then came the clank of the broken shoe!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, Alice started from her sleep and, springing to her
      feet, stood an instant listening. Then crying out, in an agonised whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;The
      horse with the clanking shoe!&rdquo; she flung her arms around me. Her face was
      white as the spectral moon which, the moment I put the candle out, looked
      in through a clear pane beside us; and she gazed fearfully, yet
      wildly-defiant, towards the door. We clung to each other. We heard the
      sound come nearer and nearer, till it thundered right up to the very door
      of the room, terribly loud. It ceased. But the door was flung open, and
      Lord Hilton entered, followed by servants with lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have but a very confused remembrance of what followed. I heard a vile
      word from the lips of Lord Hilton; I felt my fingers on his throat; I
      received a blow on the head; and I seem to remember a cry of agony from
      Alice as I fell. What happened next I do not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to myself, I was lying on a wide moor, with the night wind
      blowing about me. I presume that I had wandered thither in a state of
      unconsciousness, after being turned out of the Hall, and that I had at
      last fainted from loss of blood. I was unable to move for a long time. At
      length the morning broke, and I found myself not far from the Hall. I
      crept back, a mile or two, to the gates, and having succeeded in rousing
      Alice&rsquo;s old nurse, was taken in with many lamentations, and put to bed in
      the lodge. I had a violent fever; and it was all the poor woman could do
      to keep my presence a secret from the family at the Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I began to mend, my first question was about Alice. I learned, though
      with some difficulty&mdash;for my kind attendant was evidently unwilling
      to tell me all the truth&mdash;that Alice, too, had been very ill; and
      that, a week before, they had removed her. But she either would not or
      could not tell me where they had taken her. I believe she could not. Nor
      do I know for certain to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blakesley offered me the loan of some of her savings to get me to
      London. I received it with gratitude, and as soon as I was fit to travel,
      made my way thither. Afraid for my reason, if I had no employment to keep
      my thoughts from brooding on my helplessness, and so increasing my
      despair, and determined likewise that my failure should not make me
      burdensome to any one else, I enlisted in the Scotch Greys, before letting
      any of my friends know where I was. Through the help of one already
      mentioned in my story, I soon obtained a commission. From the field of
      Waterloo, I rode into Brussels with a broken arm and a sabre-cut in the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we passed along one of the streets, through all the clang of iron-shod
      hoofs on the stones around me, I heard the ominous clank. At the same
      moment, I heard a cry. It was the voice of my Alice. I looked up. At a
      barred window I saw her face; but it was terribly changed. I dropped from
      my horse. As soon as I was able to move from the hospital, I went to the
      place, and found it was a lunatic asylum. I was permitted to see the
      inmates, but discovered no one resembling her. I do not now believe that
      she was ever there. But I may be wrong. Nor will I trouble my reader with
      the theories on which I sought to account for the vision. They will occur
      to himself readily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years and years I know not whether she was alive or dead. I sought her
      far and near. I wandered over England, France, and Germany, hopelessly
      searching; listening at <i>tables-d&rsquo;hôte</i>; lurking about mad-houses;
      haunting theatres and churches; often, in wild regions, begging my way
      from house to house; I did not find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I visited Hilton Hall. I found it all but deserted. I learned that
      Mrs. Wilson was dead, and that there were only two or three servants in
      the place. I managed to get into the house unseen, and made my way to the
      haunted chamber. My feelings were not so keen as I had anticipated, for
      they had been dulled by long suffering. But again I saw the moon shine
      through those windows of stained glass. Again her beams were crowded with
      ghosts. She was not amongst them. &ldquo;My lost love!&rdquo; I cried; and then,
      rebuking myself, &ldquo;No; she is not lost. They say that Time and Space exist
      not, save in our thoughts. If so, then that which has been, is, and the
      Past can never cease. She is mine, and I shall find her&mdash;what matters
      it where, or when, or how? Till then, my soul is but a moon-lighted
      chamber of ghosts; and I sit within, the dreariest of them all. When she
      enters, it will be a home of love. And I wait&mdash;I wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat and brooded over the Past, till I fell asleep in the phantom-peopled
      night. And all the night long they were about me&mdash;the men and women
      of the long past. And I was one of them. I wandered in my dreams over the
      whole house, habited in a long old-fashioned gown, searching for one who
      was Alice, and yet would be some one else. From room to room I wandered
      till weary, and could not find her. At last, I gave up the search, and,
      retreating to the library, shut myself in. There, taking down from the
      shelf the volume of Von Salis, I tried hard to go on with the translation
      of <i>Pysche&rsquo;s Sorrow</i>, from the point where the student had left it,
      thinking it, all the time, my own unfinished work.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I woke in the morning, the chamber of ghosts, in which I had fallen
      asleep, had vanished. The sun shone in through the windows of the library;
      and on its dusty table lay Von Salis, open at <i>Pysche&rsquo;s Trauer</i>. The
      sheet of paper with the translation on it, was not there. I hastened to
      leave the house, and effected my escape before the servants were astir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I condensed my whole being into a single intensity of will&mdash;that
      she should come to me; and sustained it, until I fainted with the effort.
      She did not come. I desisted altogether at last, for I bethought me that,
      whether dead or alive, it must cause her torture not to be able to obey
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I questioned my own sanity. But the thought of the loss of my
      reason did not in itself trouble me much. What tortured me almost to the
      madness it supposed was the possible fact, which a return to my right mind
      might reveal&mdash;that there never had been a Lady Alice. What if I died,
      and awoke from my madness, and found a clear blue air of life, a joyous
      world of sunshine, a divine wealth of delight around and in me&mdash;but
      no Lady Alice&mdash;she having vanished with all the other phantoms of a
      sick brain! &ldquo;Rather let me be mad still,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if mad I am; and so
      dream on that I have been blessed. Were I to wake to such a heaven, I
      would pray God to let me go and live the life I had but dreamed, with all
      its sorrows, and all its despair, and all its madness, that when I died
      again, I might know that such things had been, and could never be awaked
      from, and left behind with the dream.&rdquo; But I was not mad, any more than
      Hamlet; though, like him, despair sometimes led me far along the way at
      the end of which madness lies.

      CHAPTER XVII. <i>The Physician.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was now Captain Campbell, of the Scotch Greys, contriving to live on my
      half pay, and thinking far more about the past than the present or the
      future. My father was dead. My only brother was also gone, and the
      property had passed into other hands. I had no fixed place of abode, but
      went from one spot to another, as the whim seized me&mdash;sometimes
      remaining months, sometimes removing next day, but generally choosing
      retired villages about which I knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had spent a week in a small town on the borders of Wales, and intended
      remaining a fortnight longer, when I was suddenly seized with a violent
      illness, in which I lay insensible for three weeks. When I recovered
      consciousness, I found that my head had been shaved, and that the
      cicatrice of my old wound was occasionally very painful. Of late I have
      suspected that I had some operation performed upon my skull during my
      illness; but Dr. Ruthwell never dropped a hint to that effect. This was
      the friend whom, when first I opened my seeing eyes, I beheld sitting by
      my bedside, watching the effect of his last prescription. He was one of
      the few in the profession, whose love of science and love of their fellows
      combined, would be enough to chain them to the art of healing,
      irrespective of its emoluments. He was one of the few, also, who see the
      marvellous in all science, and, therefore, reject nothing merely because
      the marvellous may seem to predominate in it. Yet neither would he accept
      anything of the sort as fact, without the strictest use of every
      experiment within his power, even then remaining often in doubt. This man
      conferred honour by his friendship; and I am happy to think that before
      many days of recovery had passed, we were friends indeed. But I lay for
      months under his care before I was able to leave my bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He attributed my illness to the consequences of the sabre-cut, and my
      recovery to the potency of the drugs he had exhibited. I attributed my
      illness in great measure to the constant contemplation of my early
      history, no longer checked by any regular employment; and my recovery in
      equal measure to the power of his kindness and sympathy, helping from
      within what could never have been reached from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me that he had often been greatly perplexed with my symptoms,
      which would suddenly change in the most unaccountable manner, exhibiting
      phases which did not, as far as his knowledge went, belong to any variety
      of the suffering which gave the prevailing character to my ailment; and
      after I had so far recovered as to render it safe to turn my regard more
      particularly upon my own case, he said to me one day,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would laugh at me, Campbell, were I to confess some of the bother
      this illness of yours has occasioned me; enough, indeed, to overthrow any
      conceit I ever had in my own diagnosis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I promise not to laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He little knew how far I should be from laughing. &ldquo;In your case,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;the <i>pathognomonic,</i> if you will excuse medical slang,
      was every now and then broken by the intrusion of altogether foreign
      symptoms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I listened with breathless attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, on several occasions, when, after meditating on your case till I
      was worn out, I had fallen half asleep by your bedside, I came to myself
      with the strangest conviction that I was watching by the bedside of a
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; I exclaimed, starting up, &ldquo;She lives still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I need not describe the doctor&rsquo;s look of amazement, almost consternation;
      for he thought a fresh access of fever was upon me, and I had already
      begun to rave. For his reassurance, however, I promised to account fully
      for my apparently senseless excitement; and that evening I commenced the
      narrative which forms the preceeding part of this story. Long before I
      reached its close, my exultation had vanished, and, as I wrote it for him,
      it ended with the expressed conviction that she must be dead. Ere long,
      however, the hope once more revived. While, however, the narrative was in
      progress, I gave him a summary, which amounted to this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had loved a lady&mdash;loved her still. I did not know where she was,
      and had reason to fear that her mind had given way under the suffering of
      our separation. Between us there existed, as well, the bond of a distant
      blood relationship; so distant, that but for its probable share in the
      production of another relationship of a very marvellous nature, it would
      scarcely have been worth alluding to. This was a kind of psychological
      attraction, which, when justified and strengthened by the spiritual
      energies of love, rendered the immediate communication of certain
      feelings, both mental and bodily, so rapid, that almost the consciousness
      of the one existed for the time in the mental circumstances of the other.
      Nay, so complete at times was the communication, that I even doubted her
      testimony as to some strange correspondence in our past history on this
      very ground, suspecting that, my memory being open to her retrospection,
      she saw my story, and took it for her own. It was, therefore, easy for me
      to account for Dr. Ruthwell&rsquo;s scientific bewilderment at the symptoms I
      manifested.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my health revived, my hope and longing increased. But although I loved
      Lady Alice with more entireness than even during the latest period of our
      intercourse, a certain calm endurance had supervened, which rendered the
      relief of fierce action no longer necessary to the continuance of a sane
      existence. It was as if the concentrated orb of love had diffused itself
      in a genial warmth through the whole orb of life, imparting fresh vitality
      to many roots which had remained leafless in my being. For years the field
      of battle was the only field that had borne the flower of delight; now
      nature began to live again for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, the first on which I ventured to walk into the fields alone, I
      was delighted with the multitude of the daisies peeping from the grass
      everywhere&mdash;the first attempts of the earth, become conscious of
      blindness, to open eyes, and see what was about and above her. Everything
      is wonderful after the resurrection from illness. It is a resurrection of
      all nature. But somehow or other I was not satisfied with the daisies.
      They did not seem to me so lovely as the daisies I used to see when I was
      a child. I thought with myself, &ldquo;This is the cloud that gathers with life,
      the dimness that passion and suffering cast over the eyes of the mind.&rdquo;
       That moment my gaze fell upon a single, solitary, red-tipped daisy. My
      reasoning vanished, and my melancholy with it, slain by the red tips of
      the lonely beauty. This was the kind of daisy I had loved as a child; and
      with the sight of it, a whole field of them rushed back into my mind; a
      field of my father&rsquo;s where, throughout the multitude, you could not have
      found a white one. My father was dead; the fields had passed into other
      hands; but perhaps the red-tipped <i>gowans</i> were left. I must go and
      see. At all events, the hill that overlooked the field would still be
      there, and no change would have passed upon <i>it.</i> It would receive me
      with the same familiar look as of old, still fronting the great mountain
      from whose sides I had first heard the sound of that clanking horseshoe,
      which, whatever might be said to account for it, had certainly had a
      fearful connection with my joys and sorrows both. Did the ghostly rider
      still haunt the place? or, if he did, should I hear again that sound of
      coming woe? Whether or not, I defied him. I would not be turned from my
      desire to see the old place by any fear of a ghostly marauder, whom I
      should be only too glad to encounter, if there were the smallest chance of
      coming off with the victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as my friend would permit me, I set out for Scotland.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. <i>Old Friends.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I made the journey by easy stages, chiefly on the back of a favourite
      black horse, which had carried me well in several fights, and had come out
      of them scarred, like his master, but sound in wind and limb. It was night
      when I reached the village lying nearest to my birth place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I woke in the morning, I found the whole region filled with a white
      mist, hiding the mountains around. Now and then a peak looked through, and
      again retired into the cloudy folds. In the wide, straggling street, below
      the window at which I had made them place my breakfast-table, a periodical
      fair was being held; and I sat looking down on the gathering crowd, trying
      to discover some face known to my childhood, and still to be recognized
      through the veil which years must have woven across the features. When I
      had finished my breakfast, I went down and wandered about among the
      people. Groups of elderly men were talking earnestly; and young men and
      maidens who had come to be <i>fee&rsquo;d</i>, were joking and laughing. They
      stared at the Sassenach gentleman, and, little thinking that he understood
      every word they uttered, made their remarks upon him in no very subdued
      tones. I approached a stall where a brown old woman was selling
      gingerbread and apples. She was talking to a man with long, white locks.
      Near them was a group of young people. One of them must have said
      something about me; for the old woman, who had been taking stolen glances
      at me, turned rather sharply towards them, and rebuked them for rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman is no Sassenach,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He understands everything you
      are saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was spoken in Gaelic, of course. I turned and looked at her with more
      observance. She made me a courtesy, and said, in the same language:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honour will be a Campbell, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Campbell,&rdquo; I answered, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honour&rsquo;s Christian name wouldn&rsquo;t be Duncan, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Duncan,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;but there are many Duncan Campbells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one to me, your honour; and that&rsquo;s yourself. But you will not
      remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not remember her. Before long, however, urged by her anxiety to
      associate her Present with my Past, she enabled me to recall in her
      time-worn features those of a servant in my father&rsquo;s house when I was a
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could you recollect me?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often seen you since I left your father&rsquo;s, sir. But it was really,
      I believe, that I hear more about you than anything else, every day of my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From old Margaret, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Margaret! Is she alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive and hearty, though quite bedridden. Why, sir, she must be within
      near sight of a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the old cottage, sir. Nothing will make her leave it. The new laird
      wanted to turn her out; but Margaret muttered something at which he grew
      as white as his shirt, and he has never ventured across her threshold
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you see so much of her, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never leave her, sir. She can&rsquo;t wait on herself, poor old lady. And
      she&rsquo;s like a mother to me. Bless her! But your honour will come and see
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will. Tell her so when you go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you honour me by sleeping at my house, sir?&rdquo; said the old man to
      whom she had been talking. &ldquo;My farm is just over the brow of the hill, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had by this time recognised him, and I accepted his offer at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When may we look for you, sir?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall you be home?&rdquo; I rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon, sir. I have done my business already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall be with you in the evening, for I have nothing to keep me
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take a seat in my gig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. I have my own horse with me. You can take him in too, I
      dare say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We parted for the meantime. I rambled about the neighbourhood till it was
      time for an early dinner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. <i>Old Constancy.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The fog cleared off; and, as the hills began to throw long, lazy shadows,
      their only embraces across the wide valleys, I mounted and set out on the
      ride of a few miles which should bring me to my old acquaintance&rsquo;s
      dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lingered on the way. All the old places demanded my notice. They seemed
      to say, &ldquo;Here we are&mdash;waiting for you.&rdquo; Many a tuft of harebells drew
      me towards the roadside, to look at them and their children, the blue
      butterflies, hovering over them; and I stopped to gaze at many a wild
      rosebush, with a sunset of its own roses. The sun had set to me, before I
      had completed half the distance. But there was a long twilight, and I knew
      the road well.
    </p>
    <p>
      My horse was an excellent walker, and I let him walk on, with the reins on
      his neck; while I, lost in a dream of the past, was singing a song of my
      own making, with which I often comforted my longing by giving it voice.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The autumn winds are sighing
  Over land and sea;
  The autumn woods are dying
  Over hill and lea;
  And my heart is sighing, dying,
  Maiden, for thee.

  The autumn clouds are flying
  Homeless over me;
  The homeless birds are crying
  In the naked tree;
  And my heart is flying, crying,
  Maiden, to thee.

  My cries may turn to gladness,
  And my flying flee;
  My sighs may lose the sadness,
  Yet sigh on in me;
  All my sadness, all my gladness,
  Maiden, lost in thee.
</pre>
    <p>
      I was roused by a heavy drop of rain upon my face. I looked up. A cool
      wave of wind flowed against me. Clouds had gathered; and over the peak of
      a hill to the left, the sky was very black. Old Constancy threw his head
      up, as if he wanted me to take the reins, and let him step out. I
      remembered that there used to be an awkward piece of road somewhere not
      far in front, where the path, with a bank on the left side, sloped to a
      deep descent on the right. If the road was as bad there as it used to be,
      it would be better to pass it before it grew quite dark. So I took the
      reins, and away went old Constancy. We had just reached the spot, when a
      keen flash of lightning broke from the cloud overhead, and my horse
      instantly stood stock-still, as if paralysed, with his nostrils turned up
      towards the peak of the mountain. I sat as still as he, to give him time
      to recover himself. But all at once, his whole frame was convulsed, as if
      by an agony of terror. He gave a great plunge, and then I felt his muscles
      swelling and knotting under me, as he rose on his hind legs, and went
      backwards, with the scaur behind him. I leaned forward on his neck to
      bring him down, but he reared higher and higher, till he stood bolt
      upright, and it was time to slip off, lest he should fall upon me. I did
      so; but my foot alighted upon no support. He had backed to the edge of the
      shelving ground, and I fell, and went to the bottom. The last thing I was
      aware of, was the thundering fall of my horse beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to myself, it was dark. I felt stupid and aching all over; but
      I soon satisfied myself that no bones were broken. A mass of something lay
      near me. It was poor Constancy. I crawled to him, laid my hand on his
      neck, and called him by his name. But he made no answer in that gentle,
      joyful speech&mdash;for it was speech in old Constancy&mdash;with which he
      always greeted me, if only after an hour&rsquo;s absence. I felt for his heart.
      There was just a flutter there. He tried to lift his head, and gave a
      little kick with one of his hind legs. In doing so, he struck a bit of
      rock, and the clank of the iron made my flesh creep. I got hold of his leg
      in the dark, and felt the shoe. <i>It was loose</i>. I felt his heart
      again. The motion had ceased. I needed all my manhood to keep from crying
      like a child; for my charger was my friend. How long I lay beside him, I
      do not know; but, at length, I heard the sound of wheels coming along the
      road. I tried to shout, and, in some measure, succeeded; for a voice,
      which I recognised as that of my farmer-friend, answered cheerily. He was
      shocked to discover that his expected guest was in such evil plight. It
      was still dark, for the rain was falling heavily; but, with his
      directions, I was soon able to take my seat beside him in the gig. He had
      been unexpectedly detained, and was now hastening home with the hope of
      being yet in time to welcome me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, after the luxurious rest of a heather-bed, I found myself
      not much the worse for my adventure, but heart-sore for the loss of my
      horse.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. <i>Margaret</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early in the forenoon, I came in sight of the cottage of Margaret. It lay
      unchanged, a grey, stone-fashioned hut, in the hollow of the
      mountain-basin. I scrambled down the soft green brae, and soon stood
      within the door of the cottage. There I was met and welcomed by Margaret&rsquo;s
      attendant. She led me to the bed where my old nurse lay. Her eyes were yet
      undimmed by years, and little change had passed upon her countenance since
      I parted with her on that memorable night. The moment she saw me, she
      broke out into a passionate lamentation such as a mother might utter over
      the maimed strength and disfigured beauty of her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ill has he done&mdash;my bairn&mdash;to be all night the sport of
      the powers of the air and the wicked of the earth? But the day will dawn
      for my Duncan yet, and a lovely day it will be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then looking at me anxiously, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not much the worse for last night, my bairn. But woe&rsquo;s me! His
      grand horse, that carried him so, that I blessed the beast in my prayers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew that no one could have yet brought her the news of my accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw me fall, then, nurse?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I did,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I see you oftener than you think. But there
      was a time when I could hardly see you at all, and I thought you were
      dead, my Duncan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stooped to kiss her. She laid the one hand that had still the power of
      motion upon my head, and dividing the hair, which had begun to be mixed
      with grey, said: &ldquo;Eh! The bonny grey hairs! My Duncan&rsquo;s a man in spite of
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She searched until she found the scar of the sabre-cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just where I thought to find it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That was a terrible day;
      worse for me than for you, Duncan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw me <i>then!</i>&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little do folks know,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;who think I&rsquo;m lying here like a
      live corpse in its coffin, what liberty my soul&mdash;and that&rsquo;s just me&mdash;enjoys.
      Little do they know what I see and hear. And there&rsquo;s no witchcraft or
      evil-doing in it, my boy; but just what the Almighty made me. Janet, here,
      declares she heard the cry that I made, when this same cut, that&rsquo;s no so
      well healed yet, broke out in your bonny head. I saw no sword, only the
      bursting of the blood from the wound. But sit down, my bairn, and have
      something to eat after your walk. We&rsquo;ll have time enough for speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janet had laid out the table with fare of the old homely sort, and I was a
      boy once more as I ate the well-known food. Every now and then I glanced
      towards the old face. Soon I saw that she was asleep. From her lips broke
      murmured sounds, so partially connected that I found it impossible to
      remember them; but the impression they left on my mind was something like
      this,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over the water. Yes; it is a rough sea&mdash;green and white. But over
      the water. There is a path for the pathless. The grass on the hill is long
      and cool. Never horse came there. If they once sleep in that grass, no
      harm can hurt them more. Over the water. Up the hill.&rdquo; And then she
      murmured the words of the psalm: &ldquo;He that dwelleth in the secret place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an hour I sat beside her. It was evidently a sweet, natural sleep, the
      most wonderful sleep of all, mingled with many a broken dream-rainbow. I
      rose at last, and, telling Janet that I would return in the evening, went
      back to my quarters; for my absence from the mid-day meal would have been
      a disappointment to the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to the cottage, I found Margaret only just awaked, and
      greatly refreshed. I sat down beside her in the twilight, and the
      following conversation began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said, nurse, that, some time ago, you could not see me. Did you know
      nothing about me all that time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it to mean that you were ill, my dear. Shortly after you left us,
      the same thing happened first; but I do not think you were ill then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to tell you all my story, dear Margaret,&rdquo; I said,
      conceiving a sudden hope of assistance from one who hovered so near the
      unseen that she often flitted across the borders. &ldquo;But would it tire you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tire me, my child!&rdquo; she said, with sudden energy. &ldquo;Did I not carry you in
      my bosom, till I loved you more than the darling I had lost? Do I not
      think about you and your fortunes, till, sitting there, you are no nearer
      to me than when a thousand miles away? You do not know my love to you,
      Duncan. I have lived upon it when, I daresay, you did not care whether I
      was alive or dead. But that was all one to my love. When you leave me now,
      I shall not care much. My thoughts will only return to their old ways. I
      think the sight of the eyes is sometimes an intrusion between the heart
      and its love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was philosophy, or something better, from the lips of an old Highland
      seeress! For me, I felt it so true, that the joy of hearing her say so
      turned, by a sudden metamorphosis, into freak. I pretended to rise, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I had better go, nurse. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put out her one hand, with a smile that revealed her enjoyment of the
      poor humour, and said, while she held me fast:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, my Duncan. A little of the scarce is sometimes dearer to us
      than much of the better. I shall have plenty of time to think about you
      when I can&rsquo;t see you, my boy.&rdquo; And her philosophy melted away into tears,
      that filled her two blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only joking,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you need to tell me that?&rdquo; she rejoined, smiling. &ldquo;I am not so old as
      to be stupid yet. But I want to hear your story. I am hungering to hear
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;I cannot speak about it before anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send Janet away. Janet, I want to talk to Mr. Campbell alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Margaret,&rdquo; answered Janet, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she listen?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She dares not,&rdquo; answered Margaret, with a smile; &ldquo;she has a terrible idea
      of my powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The twilight grew deeper; the glow of the peat-fire became redder; the old
      woman lay still as death. And I told all the story of Lady Alice. My voice
      sounded to myself as I spoke, not like my own, but like its echo from the
      vault of some listening cave, or like the voices one hears beside as sleep
      is slowly creeping over the sense. Margaret did not once interrupt me.
      When I had finished she remained still silent, and I began to fear I had
      talked her asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you help me?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Will you call Janet?&rdquo; I called her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make me a cup of tea, Janet. Will you have some tea with me, Duncan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janet lighted a little lamp, and the tea was soon set out, with
      &ldquo;flour-scons&rdquo; and butter. But Margaret ate nothing; she only drank her
      tea, lifting her cup with her one trembling hand. When the remains of our
      repast had been removed, she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Janet, you can leave us; and on no account come into the room till
      Mr. Campbell calls you. Take the lamp with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janet obeyed without a word of reply, and we were left once more alone,
      lighted only by the dull glow of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night had gathered cloudy and dark without, reminding me of that night
      when she told me the story of the two brothers. But this time no storm
      disturbed the silence of the night. As soon as Janet was gone, Margaret
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take the pillow from under my head, Duncan, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did so, and she lay in an almost horizontal position. With the living
      hand she lifted the powerless arm, and drew it across her chest, outside
      the bed-clothes. Then she laid the other arm over it, and, looking up at
      me, said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, my bairn; I need strength for what I am going to do for your
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am ready. Good-bye. Whatever happens, do not
      speak to me; and let no one come near me but yourself. It will be
      wearisome for you, but it is for your sake, my Duncan. And don&rsquo;t let the
      fire out. Don&rsquo;t leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured her I would attend to all she said. She closed her eyes, and lay
      still. I went to the fire, and sat down in a high-backed arm-chair, to
      wait the event.&mdash;There was plenty of fuel in the corner. I made up
      the fire, and then, leaning back, with my eyes fixed on it, let my
      thoughts roam at will. Where was my old nurse now? What was she seeing or
      encountering? Would she meet our adversary? Would she be strong enough to
      foil him? Was she dead for the time, although some bond rendered her
      return from the regions of the dead inevitable?&mdash;But she might never
      come back, and then I should have no tidings of the kind which I knew she
      had gone to see, and which I longed to hear!
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat thus for a long time. I had again replenished the fire&mdash;that is
      all I know about the lapse of the time&mdash;when, suddenly, a kind of
      physical repugnance and terror seized me, and I sat upright in my chair,
      with every fibre of my flesh protesting against some&mdash;shall I call it
      presence?&mdash;in its neighbourhood. But my real self repelled the
      invading cold, and took courage for any contest that might be at hand.
      Like Macbeth, I only inhabited trembling; <i>I</i> did not tremble. I had
      withdrawn my gaze from the fire, and fixed it upon the little window,
      about two feet square, at which the dark night looked in. Why or when I
      had done so I knew not.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I next relate, I relate only as what seemed to happen. I do not
      altogether trust myself in the matter, and think I was subjected to a
      delusion of some sort or other. My feelings of horror grew as I looked
      through or rather at the window, till, notwithstanding all my resolution
      and the continued assurance that nothing could make me turn my back on the
      cause of the terror, I was yet so far <i>possessed</i> by a feeling I
      could neither account for nor control, that I felt my hair rise upon my
      head, as if instinct with individual fear of its own&mdash;the only
      instance of the sort in my experience.&mdash;In such a condition, the
      sensuous nerves are so easily operated upon, either from within or from
      without, that all certainty ceases.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw two fiery eyes looking in at the window, huge, and wide apart. Next,
      I saw the outline of a horse&rsquo;s head, in which the eyes were set; and
      behind, the dimmer outline of a man&rsquo;s form seated on the horse. The
      apparition faded and reappeared, just as if it retreated, and again rode
      up close to the window. Curiously enough, I did not even fancy that I
      heard any sound. Instinctively I felt for my sword, but there was no sword
      there. And what would it have availed me? Probably I was in more need of a
      soothing draught. But the moment I put my hand to the imagined sword-hilt,
      a dim figure swept between me and the horseman, on my side of the window&mdash;a
      tall, stately female form. She stood facing the window, in an attitude
      that seemed to dare the further approach of a foe. How long she remained
      thus, or he confronted her, I have no idea; for when <i>self</i>-consciousness
      returned, I found myself still gazing at the window from which both
      apparitions had vanished. Whether I had slept, or, from the relaxation of
      mental tension, had only forgotten, I could not tell; but all fear had
      vanished, and I proceeded at once to make up the sunken fire. Throughout
      the time I am certain I never heard the clanking shoe, for that I should
      have remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the night passed without any disturbance; and when the first
      rays of the early morning came into the room, they awoke me from a
      comforting sleep in the arm-chair. I rose and approached the bed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret lay as still as death. But having been accustomed to similar
      conditions in my Alice, I believed I saw signs of returning animation, and
      withdrew to my seat. Nor was I mistaken; for, in a few minutes more, she
      murmured my name. I hastened to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call Janet,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the door, and called her. She came in a moment, looking at once
      frightened and relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me some tea,&rdquo; said Margaret once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had drunk the tea, she looked at me, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home now, Duncan, and come back about noon. Mind you go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes once more. I waited till I saw her fast in an
      altogether different sleep from the former, if sleep that could in any
      sense be called.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I went, I looked back on the vision of the night as on one of those
      illusions to which the mind, busy with its own suggestions, is always
      liable. The night season, simply because it excludes the external, is
      prolific in such. The more of the marvellous any one may have experienced
      in the course of his history, the more sceptical ought he to become, for
      he is the more exposed to delusion. None have made more blunders in the
      course of their revelations than genuine seers. Was it any wonder that, as
      I sat at midnight beside the woman of a hundred years, who had voluntarily
      died for a time that she might discover what most of all things it
      concerned me to know, the ancient tale, on which, to her mind, my whole
      history turned, and which she had herself told me in this very cottage,
      should take visible shape to my excited brain and watching eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have one thing more to tell, which strengthens still further this view
      of the matter. As I walked home, before I had gone many hundred yards from
      the cottage, I suddenly came upon my own old Constancy. He was limping
      about, picking the best grass he could find from among the roots of the
      heather and cranberry bushes. He gave a start when I came upon him, and
      then a jubilant neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not be so glad as I was. When I had taken sufficient pains to
      let him know this fact, I walked on, and he followed me like a dog, with
      his head at my heel; but as he limped much, I turned to examine him; and
      found one cause of his lameness to be, that the loose shoe, which was a
      hind one, was broken at the toe; and that one half, held only at the toe,
      had turned round and was sticking right out, striking his forefoot every
      time he moved. I soon remedied this, and he walked much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the phenomena of the night, and the share my old horse might have
      borne in them, were not the subjects, as may well be supposed, that
      occupied my mind most, on my walk to the farm. Was it possible that
      Margaret might have found out something about <i>her?</i> That was the one
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      After removing the anxiety of my hostess, and partaking of their Highland
      breakfast, a ceremony not to be completed without a glass of peaty whisky,
      I wandered to my ancient haunt on the hill. Thence I could look down on my
      old home, where it lay unchanged, though not one human form, which had
      made it home to me, moved about its precincts. I went no nearer. I no more
      felt that that was home, than one feels that the form in the coffin is the
      departed dead. I sat down in my old study-chamber among the rocks, and
      thought that if I could but find Alice she would be my home&mdash;of the
      past as well as of the future;&mdash;for in her mind my necromantic words
      would recall the departed, and we should love them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards noon I was again at the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was sitting up in bed, waiting for me. She looked weary, but
      cheerful; and a clean white <i>mutch</i> gave her a certain <i>company</i>-air.
      Janet left the room directly, and Margaret motioned me to a chair by her
      side. I sat down. She took my hand, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duncan, my boy, I fear I can give you but little help; but I will tell
      you all I know. If I were to try to put into words the things I had to
      encounter before I could come near her, you would not understand what I
      meant. Nor do I understand the things myself. They seem quite plain to me
      at the time, but very cloudy when I come back. But I did succeed in
      getting one glimpse of her. She was fast asleep. She seemed to have
      suffered much, for her face was very thin, and as patient as it was pale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where was she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave you to find out that, if you can, from my description. But,
      alas! it is only the places immediately about the persons that I can see.
      Where they are, or how far I have gone to get there, I cannot tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then gave me a rather minute description of the chamber in which the
      lady was lying. Though most of the particulars were unknown to me, the
      conviction, or hope at least, gradually dawned upon me, that I knew the
      room. Once or twice I had peeped into the sanctuary of Lady Alice&rsquo;s
      chamber, when I knew she was not there; and some points in the description
      Margaret gave set my heart in a tremor with the bare suggestion that she
      might now be at Hilton Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Margaret,&rdquo; I said, almost panting for utterance, &ldquo;was there a
      mirror over the fireplace, with a broad gilt frame, carved into huge
      representations of crabs and lobsters, and all crawling sea-creatures with
      shells on them&mdash;very ugly, and very strange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would have interrupted me before, but I would not be stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you, my dear Duncan,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that in none of these
      trances, or whatever you please to call them, did I ever see a mirror. It
      has struck me before as a curious thing, that a mirror is then an absolute
      blank to me&mdash;I see nothing on which I could put a name. It does not
      even seem a vacant space to me. A mirror must have nothing in common with
      the state I am then in, for I feel a kind of repulsion from it; and indeed
      it would be rather an awful thing to look at, for of course I should see
      no reflection of myself in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Here I beg once more to remind the reader, that Margaret spoke in Gaelic,
      and that my translation into ordinary English does not in the least
      represent the extreme simplicity of the forms of her speculations, any
      more than of the language which conveyed them.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I have a vague recollection of seeing some broad,
      big, gilded thing with figures on it. It might be something else, though,
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go in hope,&rdquo; I answered, rising at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not already, Duncan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I stay longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay over to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use? I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake, Duncan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear Margaret; for your sake. Yes, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I will not keep you longer now. But if I send
      Janet to you, come at once. And, Duncan, wear this for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put into my hand an ancient gold cross, much worn. To my amazement I
      recognised the counterpart of one Lady Alice had always worn. I pressed it
      to my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Catholic; you are a Protestant, Duncan; but never mind: that&rsquo;s the
      same sign to both of us. You won&rsquo;t part with it. It has been in our family
      for many long years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not while I live,&rdquo; I answered, and went out, half wild with hope, into
      the keen mountain air. How deliciously it breathed upon me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed the afternoon in attempting to form some plan of action at Hilton
      Hall, whither I intended to proceed as soon as Margaret set me at liberty.
      That liberty came sooner than I expected; and yet I did not go at once.
      Janet came for me towards sundown. I thought she looked troubled. I rose
      at once and followed her, but asked no questions. As I entered the
      cottage, the sun was casting the shadow of the edge of the hollow in which
      the cottage stood just at my feet; that is, the sun was more than half set
      to one who stood at the cottage door. I entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret sat, propped with pillows. I saw some change had passed upon her.
      She held out her hand to me. I took it. She smiled feebly, closed her
      eyes, and went with the sun, down the hill of night. But down the hill of
      night is up the hill of morning in other lands, and no doubt Margaret soon
      found that she was more at home there than here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat holding the dead hand, as if therein lay some communion still with
      the departed. Perhaps she who saw more than others while yet alive, could
      see when dead that I held her cold hand in my warm grasp. Had I not good
      cause to love her? She had exhausted the last remnants of her life in that
      effort to find for me my lost Alice. Whether she had succeeded I had yet
      to discover. Perhaps she knew now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastened the funeral a little, that I might follow my quest. I had her
      grave dug amidst her own people and mine; for they lay side by side. The
      whole neighbourhood for twenty miles round followed Margaret to the grave.
      Such was her character and reputation, that the belief in her supernatural
      powers had only heightened the notion of her venerableness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had seen the last sod placed on her grave, I turned and went, with
      a desolate but hopeful heart. I had a kind of feeling that her death had
      sealed the truth of her last vision. I mounted old Constancy at the
      churchyard gate, and set out for Hilton Hall.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. <i>Hilton.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a dark, drizzling night when I arrived at the little village of
      Hilton, within a mile of the Hall. I knew a respectable second-rate inn on
      the side next the Hall, to which the gardener and other servants had been
      in the habit of repairing of an evening; and I thought I might there
      stumble upon some information, especially as the old-fashioned place had a
      large kitchen in which all sorts of guests met. When I reflected on the
      utter change which time, weather, and a great scar must have made upon me,
      I feared no recognition. But what was my surprise when, by one of those
      coincidences which have so often happened to me, I found in the ostler one
      of my own troop at Waterloo! His countenance and salute convinced me that
      he recognised me. I said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you perfectly, Wood; but you must not know me. I will go with you
      to the stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wood,&rdquo; I said, when we had reached the shelter of the stable, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      want to be known here, for reasons which I will explain to you another
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir. You may depend on me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I may, and I shall. Do you know anybody about the Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. The gardener comes here sometimes, sir. I believe he&rsquo;s in the
      house now. Shall I ask him to step this way, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. All I want is to learn who is at the Hall now. Will you get him
      talking? I shall be by, having something to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. As soon as I have rubbed down the old horse, sir&mdash;bless
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went in, and, with my condition for an excuse, ordered something hot by
      the kitchen-fire. Several country people were sitting about it. They made
      room for me, and I took my place at a table on one side. I soon discovered
      the gardener, although time had done what he could to disguise him. Wood
      came in presently, and, loitering about, began to talk to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the last news at the Hall, William?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News!&rdquo; answered the old man, somewhat querulously. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never nothing
      but news up there, and very new-fangled news, too. What do you think, now,
      John? They do talk of turning all them greenhouses into hothouses; for, to
      be sure, there&rsquo;s nothing the new missus cares about but just the finest
      grapes in the country; and the flowers, purty creatures, may go to the
      devil for her. There&rsquo;s a lady for ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be glad to have her home, and see what she&rsquo;s like, won&rsquo;t you?
      It&rsquo;s rather dull up there now, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you call dull,&rdquo; replied the old man, as if half
      offended at the suggestion. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a soul missed his lordship
      when he died; and there&rsquo;s always Mrs. Blakesley and me, as is the best
      friends in the world, besides the three maids and the stableman, who helps
      me in the garden, now there&rsquo;s no horses. And then there&rsquo;s Jacob and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; said Wood, interrupting him, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s <i>none</i>
      o&rsquo; the family at home now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Who should there be? Least ways, only the poor lady. And she hardly
      counts now&mdash;bless her sweet face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever see her?&rdquo; interposed one of the by-sitters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she quite crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al-to-gether; but that quiet <i>and</i> gentle, you would think she was
      an angel instead of a mad woman. But not a notion has she in <i>her</i>
      head, no more than the babe unborn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a dreadful shock to me. Was this to be the end of all? Were it not
      better she had died? For me, life was worthless now. And there were no
      wars, with the chance of losing it honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose, and went to my own room. As I sat in dull misery by the fire, it
      struck me that it might not have been Lady Alice after all that the old
      man spoke about. That moment a tap came to my door, and Wood entered.
      After a few words, I asked him who was the lady the gardener had said was
      crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Alice,&rdquo; he answered, and added: &ldquo;A love story, that came to a bad
      end up at the Hall years ago. A tutor was in it, they say. But I don&rsquo;t
      know the rights of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he left me, I sat in a cold stupor, in which the thoughts&mdash;if
      thoughts they could be called&mdash;came and went of themselves. Overcome
      by the appearances of things&mdash;as what man the strongest may not
      sometimes be?&mdash;I felt as if I had lost her utterly, as if there was
      no Lady Alice anywhere, and as if, to add to the vacant horror of the
      world without her, a shadow of her, a goblin <i>simulacrum</i>, soul-less,
      unreal, yet awfully like her, went wandering about the place which had
      once been glorified by her presence&mdash;as to the eyes of seers the
      phantoms of events which have happened years before are still visible,
      clinging to the room in which they have indeed <i>taken place</i>. But, in
      a little while, something warm began to throb and flow in my being; and I
      thought that if she were dead, I should love her still; that now she was
      not worse than dead; it was only that her soul was out of sight. Who could
      tell but it might be wandering in worlds of too noble shapes and too high
      a speech, to permit of representation in the language of the world in
      which her bodily presentation remained, and therefore her speech and
      behaviour seemed to men to be mad? Nay, was it not in some sense better
      for me that it should be so? To see once the pictured likeness of her of
      whom I had no such memorial, would I not give years of my poverty-stricken
      life? And here was such a statue of her, as that of his wife which the
      widowed king was bending before, when he said:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;What fine chisel
  Could ever yet cut breath?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This statue I might see, &ldquo;looking like an angel,&rdquo; as the gardener had
      said. And, while the bond of visibility remained, must not the soul be,
      somehow, nearer to the earth, than if the form lay decaying beneath it?
      Was there not some possibility that the love for whose sake the reason had
      departed, might be able to recall that reason once more to the windows of
      sense,&mdash;make it look forth at those eyes, and lie listening in the
      recesses of those ears? In her somnambulic sleeps, the present body was
      the sign that the soul was within reach: so it might be still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blakesley was still at the lodge, then: I would call upon her
      to-morrow. I went to bed, and dreamed all night that Alice was sitting
      somewhere in a land &ldquo;full of dark mountains,&rdquo; and that I was wandering
      about in the darkness, alternately calling and listening; sometimes
      fancying I heard a faint reply, which might be her voice or an echo of my
      own; but never finding her. I woke in an outburst of despairing tears, and
      my despair was not comforted by my waking.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. <i>The Sleeper.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a lovely morning in autumn. I walked to the Hall. I entered at the
      same gate by which I had entered first, so many years before. But it was
      not Mrs. Blakesley that opened it. I inquired after her, and the woman
      told me that she lived at the Hall now, and took care of Lady Alice. So
      far, this was hopeful news.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up the same avenue, through the same wide grassy places, saw the
      same statue from whose base had arisen the lovely form which soon became a
      part of my existence. Then everything looked rich, because I had come from
      a poor, grand country. In all my wanderings I had seen nothing so rich;
      yet now it seemed poverty-stricken. That it was autumn could not account
      for this; for I had always found that the sadness of autumn vivified the
      poetic sense; and that the colours of decay had a pathetic glory more
      beautiful than the glory of the most gorgeous summer with all its flowers.
      It was winter within me&mdash;that was the reason; and I could feel no
      autumn around me, because I saw no spring beyond me. It had fared with my
      mind as with the garden in the <i>Sensitive Plant,</i> when the lady was
      dead. I was amazed and troubled at the stolidity with which I walked up to
      the door, and, having rung the bell, waited. No sweet memories of the past
      arose in my mind; not one of the well-known objects around looked at me as
      claiming a recognition. Yet, when the door was opened, my heart beat so
      violently at the thought that I might see her, that I could hardly stammer
      out my inquiry after Mrs. Blakesley.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was shown to a room. None of the sensations I had had on first crossing
      the threshold were revived. I remembered them all; I felt none of them.
      Mrs. Blakesley came. She did not recognise me. I told her who I was. She
      stared at me for a moment, seemed to see the same face she had known still
      glimmering through all the changes that had crowded upon it, held out both
      her hands, and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Campbell,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you <i>are</i> changed! But not like her. She&rsquo;s
      the same to look at; but, oh dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were both silent for some time. At length she resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to my room; I have been mistress here for some time now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed her to the room Mrs. Wilson used to occupy. She put wine on the
      table. I told her my story. My labours, and my wounds, and my illness,
      slightly touched as I trust they were in the course of the tale, yet moved
      all her womanly sympathies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you, Mr. Campbell?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see her,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not, sir. I don&rsquo;t know what it might do to her. It might send her
      raving; and she is so quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she ever raved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not often since the first week or two. Now and then occasionally, for an
      hour or so, she would be wild, wanting to get out. But she gave that over
      altogether; and she has had her liberty now for a long time. But, Heaven
      bless her! at the worst she was always a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am I to go away without even seeing her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry for you, Mr. Campbell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt hurt&mdash;foolishly, I confess&mdash;and rose. She put her hand on
      my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, sir. She always falls asleep in the
      afternoon; you may see her asleep, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; thank you,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;That will be much better. When shall
      I come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went wandering about the woods, and at three I was again in the
      housekeeper&rsquo;s room. She came to me presently, looking rather troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very odd,&rdquo; she began, the moment she entered, &ldquo;but for the first
      time, I think, for years, she&rsquo;s not for her afternoon sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she sleep at night?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a bairn. But she sleeps a great deal; and the doctor says that&rsquo;s
      what keeps her so quiet. She would go raving again, he says, if the sleep
      did not soothe her poor brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you not let me see her when she is asleep to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she hesitated, but presently replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, sir; but I trust to you never to mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come at ten o&rsquo;clock, then. You will find the outer door on this side
      open. Go straight to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With renewed thanks I left her and, once again betaking myself to the
      woods, wandered about till night, notwithstanding signs of an approaching
      storm. I thus kept within the boundaries of the demesne, and had no
      occasion to request re-admittance at any of the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      As ten struck on the tower-clock, I entered Mrs. Blakesley&rsquo;s room. She was
      not there. I sat down. In a few minutes she came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is fast asleep,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed, trembling. She led me to the same room Lady Alice used to
      occupy. The door was a little open. She pushed it gently, and I followed
      her in. The curtains towards the door were drawn. Mrs. Blakesley took me
      round to the other side.&mdash;There lay the lovely head, so phantom-like
      for years, coming only in my dreams; filling now, with a real presence,
      the eyes that had longed for it, as if in them dwelt an appetite of sight.
      It calmed my heart at once, which had been almost choking me with the
      violence of its palpitation. &ldquo;That is not the face of insanity,&rdquo; I said to
      myself. &ldquo;It is clear as the morning light.&rdquo; As I stood gazing, I made no
      comparisons between the past and the present, although I was aware of some
      difference&mdash;of some measure of the unknown fronting me; I was filled
      with the delight of beholding the face I loved&mdash;full, as it seemed to
      me, of mind and womanhood; sleeping&mdash;nothing more. I murmured a
      fervent &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; and was turning away with a feeling of satisfaction
      for all the future, and a strange great hope beginning to throb in my
      heart, when, after a little restless motion of her head on the pillow, her
      patient lips began to tremble. My soul rushed into my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Campbell,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I cannot spell; what am I to do to learn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected voice, naming my name, sounded in my ears like a voice from
      the far-off regions where sighing is over. Then a smile gleamed up from
      the depths unseen, and broke and melted away all over her face. But her
      nurse had heard her speak, and now approached in alarm. She laid hold of
      my arm, and drew me towards the door. I yielded at once, but heard a moan
      from the bed as I went. I looked back&mdash;the curtains hid her from my
      view. Outside the door, Mrs. Blakesley stood listening for a moment, and
      then led the way downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made her restless. You see, sir, she never was like other people,
      poor dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her face is not like one insane,&rdquo; I rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I often think she looks more like herself when she&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; answered
      she. &ldquo;And then I have often seen her smile. She never smiles when she&rsquo;s
      awake. But, gracious me, Mr. Campbell! what <i>shall</i> I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation was caused by my suddenly falling back in my chair and
      closing my eyes. I had almost fainted. I had eaten nothing since
      breakfast; and had been wandering about in a state of excitement all day.
      I greedily swallowed the glass of wine she brought me, and then first
      became aware that the storm which I had seen gathering while I was in the
      woods had now broken loose. &ldquo;What a night in the old hall!&rdquo; thought I. The
      wind was dashing itself like a thousand eagles against the house, and the
      rain was trampling the roofs and the court like troops of galloping
      steeds. I rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Blakesley interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t leave this house to-night, Mr. Campbell,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      have your death laid at my door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mrs. Blakesley,&mdash;&rdquo; I said, seeing her determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear a word,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let a horse out in
      such a tempest. No, no; you shall just sleep in your old quarters, across
      the passage there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not care for any storm. It hardly even interested me. That beautiful
      face filled my whole being. But I yielded to Mrs. Blakesley, and not
      unwillingly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. <i>My Old Room.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once more I was left alone in that room of dark oak, looking out on the
      little ivy-mantled court, of which I was now reminded by the howling of
      the storm within its high walls. Mrs. Blakesley had extemporised a bed for
      me on the old sofa; and the fire was already blazing away splendidly. I
      sat down beside it, and the sombre-hued Past rolled back upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had floated, as it were, upon the waves of memory for some time, I
      suddenly glanced behind me and around the room, and a new and strange
      experience dawned upon me. Time became to my consciousness what some
      metaphysicians say it is in itself&mdash;only a <i>form</i> of human
      thought. For the Past had returned and had become the Present. I could not
      be sure that the Past had passed, that I had not been dreaming through the
      whole series of years and adventures, upon which I was able to look back.
      For here was the room, all as before; and here was I, the same man, with
      the same love glowing in my heart. I went on thinking. The storm went on
      howling. The logs went on cheerily burning. I rose and walked about the
      room, looking at everything as I had looked at it on the night of my first
      arrival. I said to myself, &ldquo;How strange that I should feel as if all this
      had happened to me before!&rdquo; And then I said, &ldquo;Perhaps it <i>has</i>
      happened to me before.&rdquo; Again I said, &ldquo;And when it did happen before, I
      felt as if it had happened before that; and perhaps it has been happening
      to me at intervals for ages.&rdquo; I opened the door of the closet, and looked
      at the door behind it, which led into the hall of the old house. It was
      bolted. But the bolt slipped back at my touch; twelve years were nothing
      in the history of its rust; or was it only yesterday I had forced the iron
      free from the adhesion of the rust-welded surfaces? I stood for a moment
      hesitating whether to open the door, and have one peep into the wide hall,
      full of intent echoes, listening breathless for one air of sound, that
      they might catch it up jubilant and dash it into the ears of&mdash;Silence&mdash;their
      ancient enemy&mdash;their Death. But I drew back, leaving the door
      unopened; and, sitting down again by my fire, sank into a kind of
      unconscious weariness. Perhaps I slept&mdash;I do not know; but as I
      became once more aware of myself, I awoke, as it were, in the midst of an
      old long-buried night. I was sitting in my own room, waiting for Lady
      Alice. And, as I sat waiting, and wishing she would come, by slow degrees
      my wishes intensified themselves, till I found myself, with all my
      gathered might, willing that she should come. The minutes passed, but the
      will remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      How shall I tell what followed? The door of the closet opened&mdash;slowly,
      gently&mdash;and in walked Lady Alice, pale as death, her eyes closed, her
      whole person asleep. With a gliding motion as in a dream, where the
      volition that produces motion is unfelt, she seemed to me to dream herself
      across the floor to my couch, on which she laid herself down as
      gracefully, as simply, as in the old beautiful time. Her appearance did
      not startle me, for my whole condition was in harmony with the phenomenon.
      I rose noiselessly, covered her lightly from head to foot, and sat down,
      as of old to watch. How beautiful she was! I thought she had grown taller;
      but, perhaps, it was only that she had gained in form without losing
      anything in grace. Her face was, as it had always been, colourless; but
      neither it nor her figure showed any signs of suffering. The holy sleep
      had fed her physical as well as shielded her mental nature. But what would
      the waking be? Not all the power of the revived past could shut out the
      anticipation of the dreadful difference to be disclosed, the moment she
      should open those sleeping eyes. To what a frightfully farther distance
      was that soul now removed, whose return I had been wont to watch, as from
      the depths of the unknown world! That was strange; this was terrible.
      Instead of the dawn of rosy intelligence I had now to look for the fading
      of the loveliness as she woke, till her face withered into the bewildered
      and indigent expression of the insane.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was waking. My love with the unknown face was at hand. The reviving
      flush came, grew, deepened. She opened her eyes. God be praised! They were
      lovelier than ever. And the smile that broke over her face was the very
      sunlight of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come again, you see!&rdquo; she said gently, as she stretched her beautiful
      arms towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not speak. I could only submit to her embrace, and hold myself
      with all my might, lest I should burst into helpless weeping. But a sob or
      two broke their prison, and she felt the emotion she had not seen.
      Relaxing her hold, she pushed me gently from her, and looked at me with
      concern that grew as she looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dreadfully changed, my Duncan! What is the matter? Has Lord
      Hilton been rude to you? You look so much older, somehow. What can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood at once how it was. The whole of those dreary twelve years
      was gone. The thread of her consciousness had been cut, those years
      dropped out, and the ends reunited. She thought this was one of her old
      visits to me, when, as now, she had walked in her sleep. I answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you all another time. I don&rsquo;t want to waste the moments with
      you, my Alice, in speaking about it. Lord Hilton <i>has</i> behaved very
      badly to me; but never mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She half rose in anger; and her eyes looked insane for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dares he?&rdquo; she said, and then checked herself with a sigh at her own
      helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will all come right, Alice,&rdquo; I went on in terror lest I should
      disturb her present conception of her circumstances. I felt as if the very
      face I wore, with the changes of those twelve forgotten years, which had
      passed over her like the breath of a spring wind, were a mask of which I
      had to be ashamed before her. Her consciousness was my involuntary
      standard of fact. Hope of my life as she was, there was thus mingled with
      my delight in her presence a restless fear that made me wish fervently
      that she would go. I wanted time to quiet my thoughts and resolve how I
      should behave to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is nearly morning. You were late to-night. Don&rsquo;t you
      think you had better go&mdash;for fear, you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, with a smile, in which there was no doubt of fear, &ldquo;you
      are tired of me already! But I will go at once to dream about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my darling,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and mind you get some right sleep. Shall I go
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Much to my relief, she answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; please not. I can go alone as usual. When a ghost meets me, I
      just walk through him, and then he&rsquo;s nowhere; and I laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One kiss, one backward lingering look, and the door closed behind her. I
      heard the echo of the great hall. I was alone. But what a loneliness&mdash;a
      loneliness crowded with presence! I paced up and down the room, threw
      myself on the couch she had left, started up, and paced again. It was long
      before I could think. But the conviction grew upon me that she would be
      mine yet. Mine yet? Mine she <i>was</i>, beyond all the power of madness
      or demons; and mine I trusted she would be beyond the dispute of the
      world. About me, at least, she was not insane. But what should I do? The
      only chance of her recovery lay in seeing me still; but I could resolve on
      nothing till I knew whether Mrs. Blakesley had discovered her absence from
      her room; because, if I drew her, and she were watched and prevented from
      coming, it would kill her, or worse. I must take to-morrow to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet at the moment, by a sudden impulse, I opened the window gently,
      stepped into the little grassy court, where the last of the storm was
      still moaning, and withdrew the bolts of a door which led into an alley of
      trees running along one side of the kitchen-garden. I felt like a
      housebreaker; but I said, &ldquo;It is <i>her</i> right.&rdquo; I pushed the bolts
      forward again, so as just to touch the sockets and look as if they went
      in, and then retreated into my own room, where I paced about till the
      household was astir.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. <i>Prison-Breaking.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was with considerable anxiety that I repaired to Mrs. Blakesley&rsquo;s room.
      There I found the old lady at the breakfast-table, so thoroughly composed,
      that I was at once reassured as to her ignorance of what had occurred
      while she slept. But she seemed uneasy till I should take my departure,
      which I attributed to the fear that I might happen to meet Lady Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at my inn, I kept my room, my dim-seen plans rendering it
      desirable that I should attract as little attention in the neighbourhood
      as might be. I had now to concentrate these plans, and make them definite
      to myself. It was clear that there was no chance of spending another night
      at Hilton Hall by invitation: would it be honourable to go there without
      one, as I, knowing all the <i>outs and ins</i> of the place, could, if I
      pleased? I went over the whole question of Alice&rsquo;s position in that house,
      and of the crime committed against her. I saw that, if I could win my wife
      by restoring to her the exercise of reason, that very success would
      justify the right I already possessed in her. And could she not demand of
      me to climb over any walls, or break open whatsoever doors, to free her
      from her prison&mdash;from the darkness of a clouded brain? Let them say
      what they would of the meanness and wickedness of gaining such access to,
      and using such power over, the insane&mdash;she was mine, and as safe with
      me as with her mother. There is a love that tears and destroys; and there
      is a love that enfolds and saves. I hated mesmerism and its vulgar
      impertinences; but here was a power I possessed, as far as I knew, only
      over one, and that one allied to me by a reciprocal influence, as well as
      long-tried affection.&mdash;Did not love give me the right to employ this
      power?
    </p>
    <p>
      My cognitions concluded in the resolve to use the means in my hands for
      the rescue of Lady Alice. Midnight found me in the alley of the
      kitchen-garden. The door of the little court opened easily. Nor had I
      withdrawn its bolts without knowing that I could manage to open the window
      of my old room from the outside. I stood in the dark, a stranger and
      housebreaker, where so often I had sat waiting the visits of my angel. I
      secured the door of the room, struck a light, lighted a remnant of taper
      which I found on the table, threw myself on the couch, and said to my
      Alice&mdash;&ldquo;Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she came. I rose. She laid herself down. I pulled off my coat&mdash;it
      was all I could find&mdash;and laid it over her. The night was chilly. She
      revived with the same sweet smile, but, giving a little shiver, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you no fire, Duncan? I must give orders about it. That&rsquo;s some
      trick of old Clankshoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Alice, do not breath a word about me to any one. I have quarrelled
      with Lord Hilton. He has turned me away, and I have no business to be in
      the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she replied, with a kind of faint recollecting hesitation. &ldquo;That
      must be why you never come to the haunted chamber now. I go there every
      night, as soon as the sun is down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is it, Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that must be what makes the day so strange to me too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked very bewildered for a moment, and then resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Duncan, I feel very strange all day&mdash;as if I was
      walking about in a dull dream that would never come to an end? But it is
      very different at night&mdash;is it not, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not yet discovered any distinction between my presence to her
      dreams and my presence to her waking sight. I hardly knew what reply to
      make; but she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t let me come to you now, I suppose. I shall forget my Euclid
      and everything. I feel as if I had forgotten it all already. But you won&rsquo;t
      be vexed with your poor Alice, will you? She&rsquo;s only a beggar-girl, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could answer only by a caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a strange dream the other night. I thought I was sitting on a stone
      in the dark. And I heard your voice calling me. And it went all round
      about me, and came nearer, and went farther off, but I could not move to
      go to you. I tried to answer you, but I could only make a queer sound, not
      like my own voice at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dreamed it too, Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same dream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the very same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad. But I didn&rsquo;t like the dream. Duncan, my head feels so
      strange sometimes. And I am so sleepy. Duncan, dearest&mdash;am <i>I</i>
      dreaming now? Oh! tell me that I am awake and that I hold you; for
      to-morrow, when I wake, I shall fancy that I have lost you. They&rsquo;ve
      spoiled my poor brain, somehow. I am all right, I know, but I cannot get
      at it. The red is withered, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wide awake, my Alice. I know all about it. I will help you to
      understand it all, only you must do exactly as I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go to bed now, and sleep as much as you can; else I will not let you
      come to me at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be too cruel, when it is all I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go, dearest, and sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and went. I, too, went, making all close behind me. The moon was
      going down. Her light looked to me strange, and almost malignant. I feared
      that when she came to the full she would hurt my darling&rsquo;s brain, and I
      longed to climb the sky, and cut her in pieces. Was I too going mad? I
      needed rest, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, I called again upon Mrs. Blakesley, to inquire after Lady
      Alice, anxious to know how yesterday had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; answered the old lady. &ldquo;You need not look for any change.
      Yesterday I did see her smile once, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And was that nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      In her case there was a reversal of the usual facts of nature&mdash;(<i>I
      say facts</i>, not <i>laws</i>): the dreams of most people are more or
      less insane; those of Lady Alice were sound; thus, with her, restoring the
      balance of sane life. That smile was the sign of the dream-life beginning
      to leaven the waking and false life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard of young Lord Hilton&rsquo;s marriage?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Blakesley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only heard some rumours about it,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Who is the new
      countess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The daughter of a rich merchant somewhere. They say she isn&rsquo;t the best of
      tempers. They&rsquo;re coming here in about a month. I am just terrified to
      think how it may fare with my lamb now. They won&rsquo;t let her go wandering
      about wherever she pleases, I doubt. And if they shut her up, she will
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I vowed inwardly that she should be free, if I carried her off, madness
      and all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. <i>New Entrenchments.</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      But this way of breaking into the house every night did not afford me the
      facility I wished. For I wanted to see Lady Alice during the day, or at
      least in the evening before she went to sleep; as otherwise I could not
      thoroughly judge of her condition. So I got Wood to pack up a small stock
      of provisions for me in his haversack, which I took with me; and when I
      entered the house that night, I bolted the door of the court behind me,
      and made all fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited till the usual time for her appearance had passed; and, always
      apprehensive now, as was very natural, I had begun to grow uneasy, when I
      heard her voice, as I had heard it once before, singing. Fearful of
      disturbing her, I listened for a moment. Whether the song was her own or
      not, I cannot be certain. When I questioned her afterwards, she knew
      nothing about it. It was this,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Days of old,
  Ye are not dead, though gone from me;
        Ye are not cold,
  But like the summer-birds gone o&rsquo;er the sea.
  The sun brings back the swallows fast,
        O&rsquo;er the sea:
  When thou comest at the last,
  The days of old come back to me.
</pre>
    <p>
      She ceased singing. Still she did not enter. I went into the closet, and
      found that the door was bolted. When I opened it, she entered, as usual;
      and, when she came to herself, seemed still better than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duncan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but I believe I must have
      forgotten everything I ever knew. I feel as if I had. I don&rsquo;t think I can
      even read. Will you teach me my letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had a book in her hand. I hailed this as another sign that her waking
      and sleeping thoughts bordered on each other; for she must have taken the
      book during her somnambulic condition. I did as she desired. She seemed to
      know nothing till I told her. But the moment I told her anything, she knew
      it perfectly. Before she left me that night she was reading tolerably,
      with many pauses of laughter that she should ever have forgotten how. The
      moment she shared the light of my mind, all was plain; where that had not
      shone, all was dark. The fact was, she was living still in the shadow of
      that shock which her nervous constitution had received from our discovery
      and my ejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was leaving me, I said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be in the haunted room at sunset tomorrow, Alice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I shall,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find me there then,&rdquo; I rejoined&mdash;&ldquo;that is, if you think
      there is no danger of being seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;No one follows me there; not even Mrs.
      Blakesley, good soul! They are all afraid, as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t be frightened to see me there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightened? No. Why? Oh! you think me queer too, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked vexed, but tried to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I would trust you with my life,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not much, though&mdash;with
      my soul, whatever that means, Alice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; she rejoined coaxingly, &ldquo;about my being
      frightened to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone, I followed into the old hall, taking my sack with me;
      for, after having found the door in the closet bolted, I was determined
      not to spend one night more in my old quarters, and never to allow Lady
      Alice to go there again, if I could prevent her. And I had good hopes
      that, if we met in the day, the same consequences would follow as had
      followed long ago&mdash;namely, that she would sleep at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just such a night as that on which I had first peeped into the
      hall. The moon shone through one of the high windows, scarcely more dim
      than before, and showed all the dreariness of the place. I went up the
      great old staircase, hoping I trod in the very footsteps of Lady Alice,
      and reached the old gallery in which I had found her on that night when
      our strangely-knit intimacy began. My object was to choose one of the
      deserted rooms in which I might establish myself without chance of
      discovery. I had not turned many corners, or gone through many passages,
      before I found one exactly to my mind. I will not trouble my reader with a
      description of its odd position and shape. All I wanted was concealment,
      and that it provided plentifully. I lay down on the floor, and was soon
      fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, having breakfasted from the contents of my bag, I proceeded
      to make myself thoroughly acquainted with the bearings, etc., of this
      portion of the house. Before evening, I knew it all thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I found it very difficult to wait for the evening. By the windows of
      one of the rooms looking westward, I sat watching the down-going of the
      sun. When he set, my moon would rise. As he touched the horizon, I went
      the old, well-known way to the haunted chamber. What a night had passed
      for me since I left Alice in that charmed room! I had a vague feeling,
      however, notwithstanding the misfortune that had befallen us there, that
      the old phantoms that haunted it were friendly to Alice and me. But I
      waited her arrival in fear. Would she come? Would she be as in the night?
      Or should I find her but half awake to life, and perhaps asleep to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment longer, and a light hand was laid on the door. It opened
      gently, and Alice, entering, flitted across the room straight to my arms.
      How beautiful she was! her old-fashioned dress bringing her into harmony
      with the room and its old consecrated twilight! For this room looked
      eastward, and there was only twilight here. She brought me some water, at
      my request; and then we read, and laughed over our reading. Every moment
      she not only knew something fresh, but knew that she had known it before.
      The dust of the years had to be swept away; but it was only dust, and flew
      at a breath. The light soon failed us in that dusky chamber; and we sat
      and whispered, till only when we kissed could we see each other&rsquo;s eyes. At
      length Lady Alice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are looking for me; I had better go. Shall I come at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Sleep, and do not move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went, and I returned to my den. There I lay and thought. Had she ever
      been insane at all? I doubted it. A kind of mental sleep or stupor had
      come upon her&mdash;nothing more. True it might be allied to madness; but
      is there a strong emotion that man or woman experiences that is not <i>allied</i>
      to madness? Still her mind was not clear enough to reflect the past. But
      if she never recalled that entirely, not the less were her love and
      tenderness&mdash;all womanliness&mdash;entire in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next evening we met again, and the next, and many evenings. Every time I
      was more convinced than before that she was thoroughly sane in every
      practical sense, and that she would recall everything as soon as I
      reminded her. But this I forbore to do, fearing a reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, after a marvellous fashion, I was living over again the old
      lovely time that had gone by twelve years ago; living it over again,
      partly in virtue of the oblivion that had invaded the companion and source
      of the blessedness of the time. She had never ceased to live it; but had
      renewed it in dreams, unknown as such, from which she awoke to
      forgetfulness and quiet, while I awoke from my troubled fancies to tears
      and battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange, indeed, to live the past over again thus.

      CHAPTER XXVI. Escape.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was time, however, to lay some plan, and make some preparations, for
      our departure. The first thing to be secured was a convenient exit from
      the house. I searched in all directions, but could discover none better
      than that by which I had entered. Leaving the house one evening, as soon
      as Lady Alice had retired, I communicated my situation to Wood, who
      entered with all his heart into my projects. Most fortunately, through all
      her so-called madness, Lady Alice had retained and cherished the feeling
      that there was something sacred about the diamond-ring and the little
      money which had been intended for our flight before; and she had kept them
      carefully concealed, where she could find them in a moment. I had sent the
      ring to a friend in London, to sell it for me; and it produced more than I
      expected. I had then commissioned Wood to go to the county town and buy a
      light gig for me; and in this he had been very fortunate. My dear old
      Constancy had the accomplishment, not at all common to chargers, of going
      admirably in harness; and I had from the first enjoined upon Wood to get
      him into as good condition as possible. I now fixed a certain hour at
      which Wood was to be at a certain spot on one of the roads skirting the
      park, where I had found a crazy door in the plank-fence&mdash;with
      Constancy in the dogcart, and plenty of wraps for Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Wood,&rdquo; I concluded, &ldquo;look to his shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may seem strange that I should have been able to go and come thus
      without detection; but it must be remembered that I had made myself more
      familiar with the place than any of its inhabitants, and that there were
      only a very few domestics in the establishment. The gardener and stableman
      slept in the house, for its protection; but I knew their windows
      perfectly, and most of their movements. I could watch them all day long,
      if I liked, from some loophole or other of my quarter; where, indeed, I
      sometimes found that the only occupation I could think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening I said, &ldquo;Alice, I must leave the house: will you go with
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will, Duncan. When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night after to-morrow, as soon as every one is in bed and the house
      quiet. If you have anything you value very much, take it; but the lighter
      we go the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing, Duncan. I will take a little bag&mdash;that will do for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But dress as warmly as you can. It will be cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I won&rsquo;t forget that. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took it as quietly as going to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not seen Mrs. Blakesley since she had told me that the young earl
      and countess were expected in about a month; else I might have learned one
      fact which it was very important I should have known, namely, that their
      arrival had been hastened by eight or ten days. The very morning of our
      intended departure, I was looking into the court through a little round
      hole I had cleared for observation in the dust of one of the windows,
      believing I had observed signs of unusual preparation on the part of the
      household, when a carriage drove up, followed by two others, and Lord and
      Lady Hilton descended and entered, with an attendance of some eight or
      ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great bustle in the house all day. Of course I felt uneasy,
      for if anything should interfere with our flight, the presence of so many
      would increase whatever difficulty might occur. I was also uneasy about
      the treatment my Alice might receive from the new-comers. Indeed, it might
      be put out of her power to meet me at all. It had been arranged between us
      that she should not come to the haunted chamber at the usual hour, but
      towards midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was there waiting for her. The hour arrived; the house seemed quiet; but
      she did not come. I began to grow very uneasy. I waited half an hour more,
      and then, unable to endure it longer, crept to her door. I tried to open
      it, but found it fast. At the same moment I heard a light sob inside. I
      put my lips to the keyhole, and called &ldquo;<i>Alice</i>.&rdquo; She answered in a
      moment:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have locked me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The key was gone. There was no time to be lost. Who could tell what they
      might do to-morrow, if already they were taking precautions against her
      madness? I would try the key of a neighbouring door, and if that would not
      fit, I would burst the door open, and take the chance. As it was, the key
      fitted the lock, and the door opened. We locked it again on the outside,
      restored the key, and in another moment were in the haunted chamber. Alice
      was dressed, ready for flight. To me, it was very pathetic to see her in
      the shapes of years gone by. She looked faded and ancient, notwithstanding
      that this was the dress in which I had seen her so often of old. Her
      stream had been standing still, while mine had flowed on. She was a
      portrait of my own young Alice, a picture of her own former self.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two lights glancing about below detained us for a little while. We
      were standing near the window, feeling now very anxious to be clear of the
      house; Alice was holding me and leaning on me with the essence of trust;
      when, all at once, she dropped my arm, covered her face with her hands,
      and called out: &ldquo;The horse with the clanking shoe!&rdquo; At the same moment,
      the heavy door which communicated with this part of the house flew open
      with a crash, and footsteps came hurrying along the passage. A light
      gleamed into the room, and by it I saw that Lady Alice, who was standing
      close to me still, was gazing, with flashing eyes, at the door. She
      whispered hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember it all now, Duncan. My brain is all right. It is come again.
      But they shall not part us this time. You follow me for once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, I saw something glitter in her hand. She had caught up an
      old Malay creese that lay in a corner, and was now making for the door, at
      which half a dozen domestics were by this time gathered. They, too, saw
      the glitter, and made way. I followed close, ready to fell the first who
      offered to lay hands on her. But she walked through them unmenaced, and,
      once clear, sped like a bird into the recesses of the old house. One
      fellow started to follow. I tripped him up. I was collared by another. The
      same instant he lay by his companion, and I followed Alice. She knew the
      route well enough, and I overtook her in the great hall. We heard pursuing
      feet rattling down the echoing stair. To enter my room and bolt the door
      behind us was a moment&rsquo;s work; and a few moments more took us into the
      alley of the kitchen-garden. With speedy, noiseless steps, we made our way
      to the park, and across it to the door in the fence, where Wood was
      waiting for us, old Constancy pawing the ground with impatience for a good
      run.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had enough of it before twelve hours were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was I not well recompensed for my long years of despair? The cold stars
      were sparkling overhead; a wind blew keen against us&mdash;the wind of our
      own flight; Constancy stepped out with a will; and I urged him on, for he
      bore my beloved and me into the future life. Close beside me she sat,
      wrapped warm from the cold, rejoicing in her deliverance, and now and then
      looking up with tear-bright eyes into my face. Once and again I felt her
      sob, but I knew it was a sob of joy, and not of grief. The spell was
      broken at last, and she was mine. I felt that not all the spectres of the
      universe could tear her from me, though now and then a slight shudder
      would creep through me, when the clank of Constancy&rsquo;s bit would echo
      sharply back from the trees we swept past.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rested no more than was absolutely necessary; and in as short a space
      as ever horse could perform the journey, we reached the Scotch border, and
      before many more hours had gone over us, Alice was my wife.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. <i>Freedom</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Honest Wood joined us in the course of a week or two, and has continued in
      my service ever since. Nor was it long before Mrs. Blakesley was likewise
      added to our household, for she had been instantly dismissed from the
      countess&rsquo;s service on the charge of complicity in Lady Alice&rsquo;s abduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lived for some months in a cottage on a hill-side, overlooking one of
      the loveliest of the Scotch lakes. Here I was once more tutor to my Alice.
      And a quick scholar she was, as ever. Nor, I trust, was I slow in my part.
      Her character became yet clearer to me, every day. I understood her better
      and better.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could endure marvellously; but without love and its joy she could not
      <i>live</i>, in any real sense. In uncongenial society, her whole mental
      faculty had frozen; when love came, her mental world, like a garden in the
      spring sunshine, blossomed and budded. When she lost me, the Present
      vanished, or went by her like an ocean that has no milestones; she caring
      only for the Past, living only in the Past, and that reflection of it in
      the dim glass of her hope, which prefigured the Future.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have never again heard the clanking shoe. Indeed, after we had passed a
      few months in the absorption of each other&rsquo;s society, we began to find
      that we doubted a great deal of what seemed to have happened to us. It was
      as if the gates of the unseen world were closing against us, because we
      had shut ourselves up in the world of the present. But we let it go
      gladly. We felt that love was the gate to an unseen world infinitely
      beyond that region of the psychological in which we had hitherto moved;
      for this love was teaching us to love all men, and live for all men. In
      fact, we are now, I am glad to say, very much like other people; and
      wonder, sometimes, how much of the story of our lives might be accounted
      for on the supposition that unusual coincidences had fallen in with
      psychological peculiarities. Dr. Ruthwell, who is sometimes our most
      welcome guest, has occasionally hinted at the sabre-cut as the key to all
      the mysteries of the story, seeing nothing of it was at least recorded
      before I came under his charge. But I have only to remind him of one or
      two circumstances, to elicit from his honesty and immediate confession of
      bewilderment, followed by silence; although he evidently still clings to
      the notion that in that sabre-cut lies the solution of much of the marvel.
      At all events, he considers me sane enough now, else he would hardly
      honour me with so much of his confidence as he does. Having examined into
      Lady Alice&rsquo;s affairs, I claimed the fortune which she had inherited. Lord
      Hilton, my former pupil, at once acknowledged the justice of the claim,
      and was considerably astonished to find how much more might have been
      demanded of him, which had been spent over the allowance made from her
      income for her maintenance. But we had enough without claiming that.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife purchased for me the possession of my forefathers, and there we
      live in peace and hope. To her I owe the delight which I feel every day of
      my life in looking upon the haunts of my childhood as still mine. They
      help me to keep young. And so does my Alice&rsquo;s hair; for although much grey
      now mingles with mine, hers is as dark as ever. For her heart, I know that
      cannot grow old; and while the heart is young, man may laugh old Time in
      the face, and dare him to do his worst.

    <h2>
      THE CRUEL PAINTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the young men assembled at the University of Prague, in the year 159&mdash;,
      was one called Karl von Wolkenlicht. A somewhat careless student, he yet
      held a fair position in the estimation of both professors and men, because
      he could hardly look at a proposition without understanding it. Where such
      proposition, however, had to do with anything relating to the deeper
      insights of the nature, he was quite content that, for him, it should
      remain a proposition; which, however, he laid up in one of his mental
      cabinets, and was ready to reproduce at a moment&rsquo;s notice. This mental
      agility was more than matched by the corresponding corporeal excellence,
      and both aided in producing results in which his remarkable strength was
      equally apparent. In all games depending upon the combination of muscle
      and skill, he had scarce rivalry enough to keep him in practice. His
      strength, however, was embodied in such a softness of muscular outline,
      such a rare Greek-like style of beauty, and associated with such a
      gentleness of manner and behaviour, that, partly from the truth of the
      resemblance, partly from the absurdity of the contrast, he was known
      throughout the university by the diminutive of the feminine form of his
      name, and was always called Lottchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Lottchen,&rdquo; said one of his fellow-students, called Richter, across
      the table in a wine-cellar they were in the habit of frequenting, &ldquo;do you
      know, Heinrich Höllenrachen here says that he saw this morning, with
      mortal eyes, whom do you think?&mdash;Lilith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s first wife?&rdquo; asked Lottchen, with an attempt at carelessness,
      while his face flushed like a maiden&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your chaff!&rdquo; said Richter. &ldquo;Your face is honester than your
      tongue, and confesses what you cannot deny, that you would give your
      chance of salvation&mdash;a small one to be sure, but all you&rsquo;ve got&mdash;for
      one peep at Lilith. Wouldn&rsquo;t you now, Lottchen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; was all Lottchen&rsquo;s answer to his tormentor; but he
      turned to Heinrich, to whom the students had given the surname above
      mentioned, because of the enormous width of his jaws, and said with
      eagerness and envy, disguising them as well as he could, under the
      appearance of curiosity&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it, Heinrich? You&rsquo;ve been taking the beggar in! Confess
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I. I saw her with my two eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notwithstanding the different planes of their orbits,&rdquo; suggested Richter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, notwithstanding the fact that I can get a parallax to any of the
      fixed stars in a moment, with only the breadth of my nose for the base,&rdquo;
       answered Heinrich, responding at once to the fun, and careless of the
      personal defect insinuated. &ldquo;She was near enough for even me to see her
      perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When? Where? How?&rdquo; asked Lottchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hours ago. In the churchyard of St. Stephen&rsquo;s. By a lucky chance. Any
      more little questions, my child?&rdquo; answered Höllenrachen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could have taken her there, who is seen nowhere?&rdquo; said Richter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was seated on a grave. After she left, I went to the place; but it
      was a new-made grave. There was no stone up. I asked the sexton about her.
      He said he supposed she was the daughter of the woman buried there last
      Thursday week. I knew it was Lilith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mother dead!&rdquo; said Lottchen, musingly. Then he thought with himself&mdash;&ldquo;She
      will be going there again, then!&rdquo; But he took care that this ghost-thought
      should wander unembodied. &ldquo;But how did you know her, Heinrich? You never
      saw her before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you come to be over head and ears in love with her, Lottchen, and
      you haven&rsquo;t seen her at all?&rdquo; interposed Richter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you or will you not go to the devil?&rdquo; rejoined Lottchen, with a
      comic crescendo; to which the other replied with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one could miss knowing her,&rdquo; said Heinrich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she so very like, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always herself, her very self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fresh flask of wine, turning out to be not up to the mark, brought the
      current of conversation against itself; not much to the dissatisfaction of
      Lottchen, who had already resolved to be in the churchyard of St.
      Stephen&rsquo;s at sun-down the following day, in the hope that he too might be
      favoured with a vision of Lilith.
    </p>
    <p>
      This resolution he carried out. Seated in a porch of the church, not
      knowing in what direction to look for the apparition he hoped to see, and
      desirous as well of not seeming to be on the watch for one, he was gazing
      at the fallen rose-leaves of the sunset, withering away upon the sky;
      when, glancing aside by an involuntary movement, he saw a woman seated
      upon a new-made grave, not many yards from where he sat, with her face
      buried in her hands, and apparently weeping bitterly. Karl was in the
      shadow of the porch, and could see her perfectly, without much danger of
      being discovered by her; so he sat and watched her. She raised her head
      for a moment, and the rose-flush of the west fell over it, shining on the
      tears with which it was wet, and giving the whole a bloom which did not
      belong to it, for it was always pale, and now pale as death. It was indeed
      the face of Lilith, the most celebrated beauty of Prague.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she buried her face in her hands; and Karl sat with a strange
      feeling of helplessness, which grew as he sat; and the longing to help her
      whom he could not help, drew his heart towards her with a trembling
      reverence which was quite new to him. She wept on. The western roses
      withered slowly away, and the clouds blended with the sky, and the stars
      gathered like drops of glory sinking through the vault of night, and the
      trees about the churchyard grew black, and Lilith almost vanished in the
      wide darkness. At length she lifted her head, and seeing the night around
      her, gave a little broken cry of dismay. The minutes had swept over her
      head, not through her mind, and she did not know that the dark had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing her cry, Karl rose and approached her. She heard his footsteps,
      and started to her feet. Karl spoke&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be frightened,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me see you home. I will walk behind
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Karl Wolkenlicht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of you. Thank you. I can go home alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as if in a half-dreamy, half-unconscious mood, she accepted his
      offered hand to lead her through the graves, and allowed him to walk
      beside her, till, reaching the corner of a narrow street, she suddenly
      bade him good-night and vanished. He thought it better not to follow her,
      so he returned her good-night and went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to see her again was his first thought the next day; as, in fact, how
      to see her at all had been his first thought for many days. She went
      nowhere that ever he heard of; she knew nobody that he knew; she was never
      seen at church, or at market; never seen in the street. Her home had a
      dreary, desolate aspect. It looked as if no one ever went out or in. It
      was like a place on which decay had fallen because there was no indwelling
      spirit. The mud of years was baked upon its door, and no faces looked out
      of its dusty windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      How then could she be the most celebrated beauty of Prague? How then was
      it that Heinrich Höllenrachen knew her the moment he saw her? Above all,
      how was it that Karl Wolkenlicht had, in fact, fallen in love with her
      before ever he saw her? It was thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father was a painter. Belonging thus to the public, it had taken the
      liberty of re-naming him. Every one called him Teufelsbürst, or
      Devilsbrush. It was a name with which, to judge from the nature of his
      representations, he could hardly fail to be pleased. For, not as a
      nightmare dream, which may alternate with the loveliest visions, but as
      his ordinary everyday work, he delighted to represent human suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not an aspect of human woe or torture, as expressed in countenance or
      limb, came before his willing imagination, but he bore it straightway to
      his easel. In the moments that precede sleep, when the black space before
      the eyes of the poet teems with lovely faces, or dawns into a
      spirit-landscape, face after face of suffering, in all varieties of
      expression, would crowd, as if compelled by the accompanying fiends, to
      present themselves, in awful levee, before the inner eye of the expectant
      master. Then he would rise, light his lamp, and, with rapid hand, make
      notes of his visions; recording, with swift successive sweeps of his
      pencil, every individual face which had rejoiced his evil fancy. Then he
      would return to his couch, and, well satisfied, fall asleep to dream yet
      further embodiments of human ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      What wrong could man or mankind have done him, to be thus fearfully
      pursued by the vengeance of the artist&rsquo;s hate?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another characteristic of the faces and form which he drew was, that they
      were all beautiful in the original idea. The lines of each face, however
      distorted by pain, would have been, in rest, absolutely beautiful; and the
      whole of the execution bore witness to the fact that upon this original
      beauty the painter had directed the artillery of anguish to bring down the
      sky-soaring heights of its divinity to the level of a hated existence. To
      do this, he worked in perfect accordance with artistic law, falsifying no
      line of the original forms. It was the suffering, rather than his pencil,
      that wrought the change. The latter was the willing instrument to record
      what the imagination conceived with a cruelty composed enough to be
      correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enhance the beauty he had thus distorted, and so to enhance yet further
      the suffering that produced the distortion, he would often represent
      attendant demons, whom he made as ugly as his imagination could compass;
      avoiding, however, all grotesqueness beyond what was sufficient to
      indicate that they were demons, and not men. Their ugliness rose from
      hate, envy, and all evil passions; amongst which he especially delighted
      to represent a gloating exultation over human distress. And often in the
      midst of his clouds of demon faces, would some one who knew him recognise
      the painter&rsquo;s own likeness, such as the mirror might have presented it to
      him when he was busiest over the incarnation of some exquisite torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      But apparently with the wish to avoid being supposed to choose such
      representations for their own sakes, he always found a story, often in the
      histories of the church, whose name he gave to the painting, and which he
      pretended to have inspired the pictorial conception. No one, however, who
      looked upon his suffering martyrs, could suppose for a moment that he
      honoured their martyrdom. They were but the vehicles for his hate of
      humanity. He was the torturer, and not Diocletian or Nero.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, stranger yet to tell, there was no picture, whatever its subject,
      into which he did not introduce one form of placid and harmonious
      loveliness. In this, however, his fierceness was only more fully
      displayed. For in no case did this form manifest any relation either to
      the actors or the endurers in the picture. Hence its very loveliness
      became almost hateful to those who beheld it. Not a shade crossed the
      still sky of that brow, not a ripple disturbed the still sea of that
      cheek. She did not hate, she did not love the sufferers: the painter would
      not have her hate, for that would be to the injury of her loveliness:
      would not have her love, for he hated. Sometimes she floated above, as a
      still, unobservant angel, her gaze turned upward, dreaming along, careless
      as a white summer cloud, across the blue. If she looked down on the scene
      below, it was only that the beholder might see that she saw and did not
      care&mdash;that not a feather of her outspread pinions would quiver at the
      sight. Sometimes she would stand in the crowd, as if she had been copied
      there from another picture, and had nothing to do with this one, nor any
      right to be in it at all. Or when the red blood was trickling drop by drop
      from the crushed limb, she might be seen standing nearest, smiling over a
      primrose or the bloom on a peach. Some had said that she was the painter&rsquo;s
      wife; that she had been false to him; that he had killed her; and, finding
      that that was no sufficing revenge, thus half in love, and half in deepest
      hate, immortalised his vengeance. But it was now universally understood
      that it was his daughter, of whose loveliness extravagant reports went
      abroad; though all said, doubtless reading this from her father&rsquo;s
      pictures, that she was a beauty without a heart. Strange theories of
      something else supplying its place were rife among the anatomical
      students. With the girl in the pictures, the wild imagination of Lottchen,
      probably in part from her apparently absolute unattainableness and her
      undisputed heartlessness, had fallen in love, as far as the mere
      imagination can fall in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again, how was he to see her? He haunted the house night after night.
      Those blue eyes never met his. No step responsive to his came from that
      door. It seemed to have been so long unopened that it had grown as fixed
      and hard as the stones that held its bolts in their passive clasp. He
      dared not watch in the daytime, and with all his watching at night, he
      never saw father or daughter or domestic cross the threshold. Little he
      thought that, from a shot-window near the door, a pair of blue eyes, like
      Lilith&rsquo;s, but paler and colder, were watching him just as a spider watches
      the fly that is likely ere long to fall into his toils. And into those
      toils Karl soon fell. For her form darkened the page; her form stood on
      the threshold of sleep; and when, overcome with watching, he did enter its
      precincts, her form entered with him, and walked by his side. He must find
      her; or the world might go to the bottomless pit for him. But how?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. He would be a painter. Teufelsbürst would receive him as a humble
      apprentice. He would grind his colours, and Teufelsbürst would teach him
      the mysteries of the science which is the handmaiden of art. Then he might
      see her, and that was all his ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the clear morning light of a day in autumn, when the leaves were
      beginning to fall seared from the hand of that Death which has his dance
      in the chapels of nature as well as in the cathedral aisles of men&mdash;he
      walked up and knocked at the dingy door. The spider painter opened it
      himself. He was a little man, meagre and pallid, with those faded blue
      eyes, a low nose in three distinct divisions, and thin, curveless, cruel
      lips. He wore no hair on his face; but long grey locks, long as a woman&rsquo;s,
      were scattered over his shoulders, and hung down on his breast. When
      Wolkenlicht had explained his errand, he smiled a smile in which hypocrisy
      could not hide the cunning, and, after many difficulties, consented to
      receive him as a pupil, on condition that he would become an inmate of his
      house. Wolkenlicht&rsquo;s heart bounded with delight, which he tried to hide:
      the second smile of Teufelsbürst might have shown him that he had ill
      succeeded. The fact that he was not a native of Prague, but coming from a
      distant part of the country, was entirely his own master in the city,
      rendered this condition perfectly easy to fulfil; and that very afternoon
      he entered the studio of Teufelsbürst as his scholar and servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great room, filled with the appliances and results of art. Many
      pictures, festooned with cobwebs, were hung carelessly on the dirty walls.
      Others, half finished, leaned against them, on the floor. Several, in
      different stages of progress, stood upon easels. But all spoke the cruel
      bent of the artist&rsquo;s genius. In one corner a lay figure was extended on a
      couch, covered with a pall of black velvet. Through its folds, the form
      beneath was easily discernible; and one hand and forearm protruded from
      beneath it, at right angles to the rest of the frame. Lottchen could not
      help shuddering when he saw it. Although he overcame the feeling in a
      moment, he felt a great repugnance to seating himself with his back
      towards it, as the arrangement of an easel, at which Teufelsbürst wished
      him to draw, rendered necessary. He contrived to edge himself round, so
      that when he lifted his eyes he should see the figure, and be sure that it
      could not rise without his being aware of it. But his master saw and
      understood his altered position; and under some pretence about the light,
      compelled him to resume the position in which he had placed him at first;
      after which he sat watching, over the top of his picture, the expression
      of his countenance as he tried to draw; reading in it the horrid fancy
      that the figure under the pall had risen, and was stealthily approaching
      to look over his shoulder. But Lottchen resisted the feeling, and, being
      already no contemptible draughtsman, was soon interested enough to forget
      it. And then, any moment <i>she</i> might enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now began a system of slow torture, for the chance of which the painter
      had been long on the watch&mdash;especially since he had first seen Karl
      lingering about the house. His opportunities of seeing physical suffering
      were nearly enough even for the diseased necessities of his art; but now
      he had one in his power, on whom, his own will fettering him, he could try
      any experiments he pleased for the production of a kind of suffering, in
      the observation of which he did not consider that he had yet sufficient
      experience. He would hold the very heart of the youth in his hand, and
      wring it and torture it to his own content. And lest Karl should be strong
      enough to prevent those expressions of pain for which he lay on the watch,
      he would make use of further means, known to himself, and known to few
      besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day Karl saw nothing of Lilith; but he heard her voice once&mdash;and
      that was enough for one day. The next, she was sitting to her father the
      greater part of the day, and he could see her as often as he dared glance
      up from his drawing. She had looked at him when she entered, but had shown
      no sign of recognition; and all day long she took no further notice of
      him. He hoped, at first, that this came of the intelligence of love; but
      he soon began to doubt it. For he saw that, with the holy shadow of
      sorrow, all that distinguished the expression of her countenance from that
      which the painter so constantly reproduced, had vanished likewise. It was
      the very face of the unheeding angel whom, as often as he lifted his eyes
      higher than hers, he saw on the wall above her, playing on a psaltery in
      the smoke of the torment ascending for ever from burning Babylon.&mdash;The
      power of the painter had not merely wrought for the representation of the
      woman of his imagination; it had had scope as well in realising her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl soon began to see that communication, other than of the eyes, was all
      but hopeless; and to any attempt in that way she seemed altogether
      indisposed to respond. Nor if she had wished it, would it have been safe;
      for as often as he glanced towards her, instead of hers, he met the blue
      eyes of the painter gleaming upon him like winter lightning. His tones,
      his gestures, his words, seemed kind: his glance and his smile refused to
      be disguised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day he dined alone in the studio, waited upon by an old woman;
      the next he was admitted to the family table, with Teufelsbürst and
      Lilith. The room offered a strange contrast to the study. As far as
      handicraft, directed by a sumptuous taste, could construct a
      house-paradise, this was one. But it seemed rather a paradise of demons;
      for the walls were covered with Teufelsbürst&rsquo;s paintings. During the
      dinner, Lilith&rsquo;s gaze scarcely met that of Wolkenlicht; and once or twice,
      when their eyes did meet, her glance was so perfectly unconcerned, that
      Karl wished he might look at her for ever without the fear of her looking
      at him again. She seemed like one whose love had rushed out glowing with
      seraphic fire, to be frozen to death in a more than wintry cold: she now
      walked lonely without her love. In the evenings, he was expected to
      continue his drawing by lamplight; and at night he was conducted by
      Teufelsbürst to his chamber. Not once did he allow him to proceed thither
      alone, and not once did he leave him there without locking and bolting the
      door on the outside. But he felt nothing except the coldness of Lilith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day she sat to her father, in every variety of costume that
      could best show the variety of her beauty. How much greater that beauty
      might be, if it ever blossomed into a beauty of soul, Wolkenlicht never
      imagined; for he soon loved her enough to attribute to her all the
      possibilities of her face as actual possessions of her being. To account
      for everything that seemed to contradict this perfection, his brain was
      prolific in inventions; till he was compelled at last to see that she was
      in the condition of a rose-bud, which, on the point of blossoming, had
      been chilled into a changeless bud by the cold of an untimely frost. For
      one day, after the father and daughter had become a little more accustomed
      to his silent presence, a conversation began between them, which went on
      until he saw that Teufelsbürst believed in nothing except his art. How
      much of his feeling for that could be dignified by the name of belief,
      seeing its objects were such as they were, might have been questioned. It
      seemed to Wolkenlicht to amount only to this: that, amidst a thousand
      distastes, it was a pleasant thing to reproduce on the canvas the forms he
      beheld around him, modifying them to express the prevailing feelings of
      his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more desolate communication between souls than that which then passed
      between father and daughter could hardly be imagined. The father spoke of
      humanity and all its experiences in a tone of the bitterest scorn. He
      despised men, and himself amongst them; and rejoiced to think that the
      generations rose and vanished, brood after brood, as the crops of corn
      grew and disappeared. Lilith, who listened to it all unmoved, taking only
      an intellectual interest in the question, remarked that even the corn had
      more life than that; for, after its death, it rose again in the new crop.
      Whether she meant that the corn was therefore superior to man, forgetting
      that the superior can produce being without losing its own, or only
      advanced an objection to her father&rsquo;s argument, Wolkenlicht could not
      tell. But Teufelsbürst laughed like the sound of a saw, and said: &ldquo;Follow
      out the analogy, my Lilith, and you will see that man is like the corn
      that springs again after it is buried; but unfortunately the only result
      we know of is a vampire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wolkenlicht looked up, and saw a shudder pass through the frame, and over
      the pale thin face of the painter. This he could not account for. But
      Teufelsbürst could have explained it, for there were strange whispers
      abroad, and they had reached his ear; and his philosophy was not quite
      enough for them. But the laugh with which Lilith met this frightful
      attempt at wit, grated dreadfully on Wolkenlicht&rsquo;s feeling. With her, too,
      however, a reaction seemed to follow. For, turning round a moment after,
      and looking at the picture on which her father was working, the tears rose
      in her eyes, and she said: &ldquo;Oh! father, how like my mother you have made
      me this time!&rdquo; &ldquo;Child!&rdquo; retorted the painter with a cold fierceness, &ldquo;you
      have no mother. That which is gone out is gone out. Put no name in my
      hearing on that which is not. Where no substance is, how can there be a
      name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilith rose and left the room. Wolkenlicht now understood that Lilith was
      a frozen bud, and could not blossom into a rose. But pure love lives by
      faith. It loves the vaguely beheld and unrealised ideal. It dares believe
      that the loved is not all that she ever seemed. It is in virtue of this
      that love loves on. And it was in virtue of this, that Wolkenlicht loved
      Lilith yet more after he discovered what a grave of misery her unbelief
      was digging for her within her own soul. For her sake he would bear
      anything&mdash;bear even with calmness the torments of his own love; he
      would stay on, hoping and hoping.&mdash;The text, that we know not what a
      day may bring forth, is just as true of good things as of evil things; and
      out of Time&rsquo;s womb the facts must come.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with the birth of this resolution to endure, his suffering abated; his
      face grew more calm; his love, no less earnest, was less imperious; and he
      did not look up so often from his work when Lilith was present. The master
      could see that his pupil was more at ease, and that he was making rapid
      progress in his art. This did not suit his designs, and he would betake
      himself to his further schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this purpose he proceeded first to simulate a friendship for
      Wolkenlicht, the manifestations of which he gradually increased, until,
      after a day or two, he asked him to drink wine with him in the evening.
      Karl readily agreed. The painter produced some of his best; but took care
      not to allow Lilith to taste it; for he had cunningly prepared and mingled
      with it a decoction of certain herbs and other ingredients, exercising
      specific actions upon the brain, and tending to the inordinate excitement
      of those portions of it which are principally under the rule of the
      imagination. By the reaction of the brain during the operation of these
      stimulants, the imagination is filled with suggestions and images. The
      nature of these is determined by the prevailing mood of the time. They are
      such as the imagination would produce of itself, but increased in number
      and intensity. Teufelsbürst, without philosophising about it, called his
      preparation simply a love-philtre, a concoction well known by name, but
      the composition of which was the secret of only a few. Wolkenlicht had, of
      course, not the least suspicion of the treatment to which he was
      subjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teufelsbürst was, however, doomed to fresh disappointment. Not that his
      potion failed in the anticipated effect, for now Karl&rsquo;s real sufferings
      began; but that such was the strength of Karl&rsquo;s will, and his fear of
      doing anything that might give a pretext for banishing him from the
      presence of Lilith, that he was able to conceal his feelings far too
      successfully for the satisfaction of Teufelsbürst&rsquo;s art. Yet he had to
      fetter himself with all the restraints that self-exhortation could load
      him with, to refrain from falling at the feet of Lilith and kissing the
      hem of her garment. For that, as the lowliest part of all that surrounded
      her, itself kissing the earth, seemed to come nearest within the reach of
      his ambition, and therefore to draw him the most.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt the painter had experience and penetration enough to perceive
      that he was suffering intensely; but he wanted to see the suffering
      embodied in outward signs, bringing it within the region over which his
      pencil held sway. He kept on, therefore, trying one thing after another,
      and rousing the poor youth to agony; till to his other sufferings were
      added, at length, those of failing health; a fact which notified itself
      evidently enough even for Teufelsbürst, though its signs were not of the
      sort he chiefly desired. But Karl endured all bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, for various reasons, he scarcely ever left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must now interrupt the course of my story to introduce another element.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years before the period of my tale, a certain shoemaker of the city
      had died under circumstances more than suggestive of suicide. He was
      buried, however, with such precautions, that six weeks elapsed before the
      rumour of the facts broke out; upon which rumour, not before, the most
      fearful reports began to be circulated, supported by what seemed to the
      people of Prague incontestable evidence.&mdash;A <i>spectrum</i> of the
      deceased appeared to multitudes of persons, playing horrible pranks, and
      occasioning indescribable consternation throughout the whole town. This
      went on till at last, about eight months after his burial, the magistrates
      caused his body to be dug up; when it was found in just the condition of
      the bodies of those who in the eastern countries of Europe are called <i>vampires</i>.
      They buried the corpse under the gallows; but neither the digging up nor
      the reburying were of avail to banish the spectre. Again the spade and
      pick-axe were set to work, and the dead man being found considerably
      improved in <i>condition</i> since his last interment, was, with various
      horrible indignities, burnt to ashes, &ldquo;after which the <i>spectrum</i> was
      never seen more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a second epidemic of the same nature had broken out a little before
      the period to which I have brought my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midnight, after a calm frosty day, for it was now winter, a terrible
      storm of wind and snow came on. The tempest howled frightfully about the
      house of the painter, and Wolkenlicht found some solace in listening to
      the uproar, for his troubled thoughts would not allow him to sleep. It
      raged on all the next three days, till about noon on the fourth day, when
      it suddenly fell, and all was calm. The following night, Wolkenlicht,
      lying awake, heard unaccountable noises in the next house, as of things
      thrown about, of kicking and fighting horses, and of opening and shutting
      gates. Flinging wide his lattice and looking out, the noise of howling
      dogs came to him from every quarter of the town. The moon was bright and
      the air was still. In a little while he heard the sounds of a horse going
      at full gallop round the house, so that it shook as if it would fall; and
      flashes of light shone into his room. How much of this may have been owing
      to the effect of the drugs on poor Lottchen&rsquo;s brain, I leave my readers to
      determine. But when the family met at breakfast in the morning,
      Teufelsbürst, who had been already out of doors, reported that he had
      found the marks of strange feet in the snow, all about the house and
      through the garden at the back; stating, as his belief, that the tracks
      must be continued over the roofs, for there was no passage otherwise.
      There was a wicked gleam in his eye as he spoke; and Lilith believed that
      he was only trying an experiment on Karl&rsquo;s nerves. He persisted that he
      had never seen any footprints of the sort before. Karl informed him of his
      experiences during the night; upon which Teufelsbürst looked a little
      graver still, and proceeded to tell them that the storm, whose snow was
      still covering the ground, had arisen the very moment that their next door
      neighbour died, and had ceased as suddenly the moment he was buried,
      though it had raved furiously all the time of the funeral, so that &ldquo;it
      made men&rsquo;s bodies quake and their teeth chatter in their heads.&rdquo; Karl had
      heard that the man, whose name was John Kuntz, was dead and buried. He
      knew that he had been a very wealthy, and therefore most respectable,
      alderman of the town; that he had been very fond of horses; and that he
      had died in consequence of a kick received from one of his own, as he was
      looking at his hoof. But he had not heard that, just before he died, a
      black cat &ldquo;opened the casement with her nails, ran to his bed, and
      violently scratched his face and the bolster, as if she endeavoured by
      force to remove him out of the place where he lay. But the cat afterwards
      was suddenly gone, and she was no sooner gone, but he breathed his last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So said Teufelsbürst, as the reporter of the town talk. Lilith looked very
      pale and terrified; and it was perhaps owing to this that the painter
      brought no more tales home with him. There were plenty to bring, but he
      heard them all and said nothing. The fact was that the philosopher himself
      could not resist the infection of the fear that was literally raging in
      the city; and perhaps the reports that he himself had sold himself to the
      devil had sufficient response from his own evil conscience to add to the
      influence of the epidemic upon him. The whole place was infested with the
      presence of the dead Kuntz, till scarce a man or woman would dare to be
      alone. He strangled old men; insulted women; squeezed children to death;
      knocked out the brains of dogs against the ground; pulled up posts; turned
      milk into blood; nearly killed a worthy clergyman by breathing upon him
      the intolerable airs of the grave, cold and malignant and noisome; and, in
      short, filled the city with a perfect madness of fear, so that every
      report was believed without the smallest doubt or investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Teufelsbürst brought home no more of the town talk, the old servant
      was a faithful purveyor, and frequented the news-mart assiduously. Indeed
      she had some nightmare experiences of her own that she was proud to add to
      the stock of horrors which the city enjoyed with such a hearty community
      of goods. For those regions were not far removed from the birthplace and
      home of the vampire. The belief in vampires is the quintessential
      concentration and embodiment of all the passion of fear in Hungary and the
      adjacent regions. Nor, of all the other inventions of the human
      imagination, has there ever been one so perfect in crawling terror as
      this. Lilith and Karl were quite familiar with the popular ideas on the
      subject. It did not require to be explained to them, that a vampire was a
      body retaining a kind of animal life after the soul had departed. If any
      relation existed between it and the vanished ghost, it was only sufficient
      to make it restless in its grave. Possessed of vitality enough to keep it
      uncorrupted and pliant, its only instinct was a blind hunger for the sole
      food which could keep its awful life persistent&mdash;living human blood.
      Hence it, or, if not it, a sort of semi-material exhalation or essence of
      it, retaining its form and material relations, crept from its tomb, and
      went roaming about till it found some one asleep, towards whom it had an
      attraction, founded on old affection. It sucked the blood of this unhappy
      being, transferring so much of its life to itself as a vampire could
      assimilate. Death was the certain consequence. If suspicion conjectured
      aright, and they opened the proper grave, the body of the vampire would be
      found perfectly fresh and plump, sometimes indeed of rather florid
      complexion;&mdash;with grown hair, eyes half open, and the stains of
      recent blood about its greedy, leech-like lips. Nothing remained but to
      consume the corpse to ashes, upon which the vampire would show itself no
      more. But what added infinitely to the horror was the certainty that
      whoever died from the mouth of the vampire, wrinkled grandsire or delicate
      maiden, must in turn rise from the grave, and go forth a vampire, to suck
      the blood of the dearest left behind. This was the generation of the
      vampire brood. Lilith trembled at the very name of the creature. Karl was
      too much in love to be afraid of anything. Yet the evident fear of the
      unbelieving painter took a hold of his imagination; and, under the
      influence of the potions of which he still partook unwittingly, when he
      was not thinking about Lilith, he was thinking about the vampire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the condition of things in the painter&rsquo;s household continued
      much the same for Wolkenlicht&mdash;work all day; no communication between
      the young people; the dinner and the wine; silent reading when work was
      done, with stolen glances many over the top of the book, glances that were
      never returned; the cold good-night; the locking of the door; the wakeful
      night and the drowsy morning. But at length a change came, and sooner than
      any of the party had expected. For, whether it was that the impatience of
      Teufelsbürst had urged him to yet more dangerous experiments, or that the
      continuance of those he had been so long employing had overcome at length
      the vitality of Wolkenlicht&mdash;one afternoon, as he was sitting at his
      work, he suddenly dropped from his chair, and his master hurrying to him
      in some alarm, found him rigid and apparently lifeless. Lilith was not in
      the study when this took place. In justice to Teufelsbürst, it must be
      confessed that he employed all the skill he was master of, which for
      beneficent purposes was not very great, to restore the youth; but without
      avail. At last, hearing the footsteps of Lilith, he desisted in some
      consternation; and that she might escape being shocked by the sight of a
      dead body where she had been accustomed to see a living one, he removed
      the lay figure from the couch, and laid Karl in its place, covering him
      with a black velvet pall. He was just in time. She started at seeing no
      one in Karl&rsquo;s place and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your pupil, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone home,&rdquo; he answered, with a kind of convulsive grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced round the room, caught sight of the lay figure where it had
      not been before, looked at the couch, and saw the pall yet heaved up from
      beneath, opened her eyes till the entire white sweep around the iris
      suggested a new expression of consternation to Teufelsbürst, though from a
      quarter whence he did not desire or look for it; and then, without a word,
      sat down to a drawing she had been busy upon the day before. But her
      father, glancing at her now, as Wolkenlicht had used to do, could not help
      seeing that she was frightfully pale. She showed no other sign of
      uneasiness. As soon as he released her, she withdrew, with one more
      glance, as she passed, at the couch and the figure blocked out in black
      upon it. She hastened to her chamber, shut and locked the door, sat down
      on the side of the couch, and fell, not a-weeping, but a-thinking. Was he
      dead? What did it matter? They would all be dead soon. Her mother was dead
      already. It was only that the earth could not bear more children, except
      she devoured those to whom she had already given birth. But what if they
      had to come back in another form, and live another sad, hopeless,
      love-less life over again?&mdash;And so she went on questioning, and
      receiving no replies; while through all her thoughts passed and repassed
      the eyes of Wolkenlicht, which she had often felt to be upon her when she
      did not see them, wild with repressed longing, the light of their love
      shining through the veil of diffused tears, ever gathering and never
      overflowing. Then came the pale face, so worshipping, so distant in its
      self-withdrawn devotion, slowly dawning out of the vapours of her reverie.
      When it vanished, she tried to see it again. It would not come when she
      called it; but when her thoughts left knocking at the door of the lost,
      and wandered away, out came the pale, troubled, silent face again,
      gathering itself up from some unknown nook in her world of phantasy, and
      once more, when she tried to steady it by the fixedness of her own regard,
      fading back into the mist. So the phantasm of the dead drew near and
      wooed, as the living had never dared.&mdash;What if there were any good in
      loving? What if men and women did not die all out, but some dim shade of
      each, like that pale, mind-ghost of Wolkenlicht, floated through the
      eternal vapours of chaos? And what if they might sometimes cross each
      other&rsquo;s path, meet, know that they met, love on? Would not that revive the
      withered memory, fix the fleeting ghost, give a new habitation, a body
      even, to the poor, unhoused wanderers, frozen by the eternal frosts, no
      longer thinking beings, but thoughts wandering through the brain of the
      &ldquo;Melancholy Mass?&rdquo; Back with the thought came the face of the dead Karl,
      and the maiden threw herself on her bed in a flood of bitter tears. She
      could have loved him if he had only lived: she did love him, for he was
      dead. But even in the midst of the remorse that followed&mdash;for had she
      not killed him?&mdash;life seemed a less hard and hopeless thing than
      before. For it is love itself and not its responses or results that is the
      soul of life and its pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours passed ere she could again show herself to her father, from whom
      she seemed in some new way divided by the new feeling in which he did not,
      and could not share. But at last, lest he should seek her, and finding
      her, should suspect her thoughts, she descended and sought him.&mdash;For
      there is a maidenliness in sorrow, that wraps her garments close around
      her.&mdash;But he was not to be seen; the door of the study was locked. A
      shudder passed through her as she thought of what her father, who lost no
      opportunity of furthering his all but perfect acquaintance with the human
      form and structure, might be about with the figure which she knew lay dead
      beneath that velvet pall, but which had arisen to haunt the hollow caves
      and cells of her living brain. She rushed away, and up once more to her
      silent room, through the darkness which had now settled down in the house;
      threw herself again on her bed, and lay almost paralysed with horror and
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Teufelsbürst was not about anything so frightful as she supposed,
      though something frightful enough. I have already implied that Wolkenlicht
      was, in form, as fine an embodiment of youthful manhood as any old Greek
      republic could have provided one of its sculptors with as model for an
      Apollo. It is true, that to the eye of a Greek artist he would not have
      been more acceptable in consequence of the regimen he had been going
      through for the last few weeks; but the emaciation of Wolkenlicht&rsquo;s frame,
      and the consequent prominence of the muscles, indicating the pain he had
      gone through, were peculiarly attractive to Teufelsbürst.&mdash;He was
      busy preparing to take a cast of the body of his dead pupil, that it might
      aid to the perfection of his future labours.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was deep in the artistic enjoyment of a form, at the same time so
      beautiful and strong, yet with the lines of suffering in every limb and
      feature, when his daughter&rsquo;s hand was laid on the latch. He started, flung
      the velvet drapery over the body, and went to the door. But Lilith had
      vanished. He returned to his labours. The operation took a long time, for
      he performed it very carefully. Towards midnight, he had finished encasing
      the body in a close-clinging shell of plaster, which, when broken off, and
      fitted together, would be the matrix to the form of the dead Wolkenlicht.
      Before leaving it to harden till the morning, he was just proceeding to
      strengthen it with an additional layer all over, when a flash of
      lightning, reflected in all its dazzle from the snow without, almost
      blinded him. A peal of long-drawn thunder followed; the wind rose; and
      just such a storm came on as had risen some time before at the death of
      Kuntz, whose spectre was still tormenting the city. The gnomes of terror,
      deep hidden in the caverns of Teufelsbürst&rsquo;s nature, broke out jubilant.
      With trembling hands he tried to cast the pall over the awful white
      chrysalis,&mdash;failed, and fled to his chamber. And there lay the studio
      naked to the eyes of the lightning, with its tortured forms throbbing out
      of the dark, and quivering, as with life, in the almost continuous
      palpitations of the light; while on the couch lay the motionless mass of
      whiteness, gleaming blue in the lightning, almost more terrible in its
      crude indications of the human form, than that which it enclosed. It lay
      there as if dropped from some tree of chaos, haggard with the snows of
      eternity&mdash;a huge mis-shapen nut, with a corpse for its kernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lightning would soon have revealed a more terrible sight still,
      had there been any eyes to behold it. At midnight, while a peal of thunder
      was just dying away in the distance, the crust of death flew asunder,
      rending in all directions; and, pale as his investiture, staring with
      ghastly eyes, the form of Karl started up sitting on the couch. Had he not
      been far beyond ordinary men in strength, he could not thus have rent his
      sepulchre. Indeed, had Teufelsbürst been able to finish his task by the
      additional layer of gypsum which he contemplated, he must have died the
      moment life revived; although, so long as the trance lasted, neither the
      exclusion from the air, nor the practical solidification of the walls of
      his chest, could do him any injury. He had lain unconscious throughout the
      operations of Teufelsbürst, but now the catalepsy had passed away,
      possibly under the influence of the electric condition of the atmosphere.
      Very likely the strength he now put forth was intensified by a convulsive
      reaction of all the powers of life, as is not infrequently the case in
      sudden awakenings from similar interruptions of vital activity. The coming
      to himself and the bursting of his case were simultaneous. He sat staring
      about him, with, of all his mental faculties, only his imagination awake,
      from which the thoughts that occupied it when he fell senseless had not
      yet faded. These thoughts had been compounded of feelings about Lilith,
      and speculations about the vampire that haunted the neighbourhood; and the
      fumes of the last drug of which he had partaken, still hovering in his
      brain, combined with these thoughts and fancies to generate the delusion
      that he had just broken from the embrace of his coffin, and risen, the
      last-born of the vampire race. The sense of unavoidable obligation to
      fulfil his doom, was yet mingled with a faint flutter of joy, for he knew
      that he must go to Lilith. With a deep sigh, he rose, gathered up the pall
      of black velvet, flung it around him, stepped from the couch, and left the
      study to find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Teufelsbürst had sufficiently recovered to remember that he had
      left the door of the studio unfastened, and that any one entering would
      discover in what he had been engaged, which, in the case of his getting
      into any difficulty about the death of Karl, would tell powerfully against
      him. He was at the farther end of a long passage, leading from the house
      to the studio, on his way to make all secure, when Karl appeared at the
      door, and advanced towards him. The painter, seized with invincible
      terror, turned and fled. He reached his room, and fell senseless on the
      floor. The phantom held on its way, heedless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilith, on gaining her room the second time, had thrown herself on her bed
      as before, and had wept herself into a troubled slumber. She lay dreaming&mdash;and
      dreadful dreams. Suddenly she awoke in one of those peals of thunder which
      tormented the high regions of the air, as a storm billows the surface of
      the ocean. She lay awake and listened. As it died away, she thought she
      heard, mingling with its last muffled murmurs, the sound of moaning. She
      turned her face towards the room in keen terror. But she saw nothing.
      Another light, long-drawn sigh reached her ear, and at the same moment a
      flash of lightning illumined the room. In the corner farthest from her
      bed, she spied a white face, nothing more. She was dumb and motionless
      with fear. Utter darkness followed, a darkness that seemed to enter into
      her very brain. Yet she felt that the face was slowly crossing the black
      gulf of the room, and drawing near to where she lay. The next flash
      revealed, as it bended over her, the ghastly face of Karl, down which
      flowed fresh tears. The rest of his form was lost in blackness. Lilith did
      not faint, but it was the very force of her fear that seemed to keep her
      alive. It became for the moment the atmosphere of her life. She lay
      trembling and staring at the spot in the darkness where she supposed the
      face of Karl still to be. But the next flash showed her the face far off,
      looking at her through the panes of her lattice-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Lottchen, as soon as he saw Lilith, seemed to himself to go through a
      second stage of awaking. Her face made him doubt whether he could be a
      vampire after all; for instead of wanting to bite her arm and suck the
      blood, he all but fell down at her feet in a passion of speechless love.
      The next moment he became aware that his presence must be at least very
      undesirable to her; and in an instant he had reached her window, which he
      knew looked upon a lower roof that extended between two different parts of
      the house, and before the next flash came, he had stepped through the
      lattice and closed it behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believing his own room to be attainable from this quarter, he proceeded
      along the roof in the direction he judged best. The cold winter air by
      degrees restored him entirely to his right mind, and he soon comprehended
      the whole of the circumstances in which he found himself. Peeping through
      a window he was passing, to see whether it belonged to his room, he spied
      Teufelsbürst, who, at the very moment, was lifting his head from the faint
      into which he had fallen at the first sight of Lottchen. The moon was
      shining clear, and in its light the painter saw, to his horror, the pale
      face staring in at his window. He thought it had been there ever since he
      had fainted, and dropped again in a deeper swoon than before. Karl saw him
      fall, and the truth flashed upon him that the wicked artist took him for
      what he had believed himself to be when first he recovered from his trance&mdash;namely,
      the vampire of the former Karl Wolkenlicht. The moment he comprehended it,
      he resolved to keep up the delusion if possible. Meantime he was
      innocently preparing a new ingredient for the popular dish of horrors to
      be served at the ordinary of the city the next day. For the old servant&rsquo;s
      were not the only eyes that had seen him besides those of Teufelsbürst.
      What could be more like a vampire, dragging his pall after him, than this
      apparition of poor, half-frozen Lottchen, crawling across the roof? Karl
      remembered afterwards that he had heard the dogs howling awfully in every
      direction, as he crept along; but this was hardly necessary to make those
      who saw him conclude that it was the same phantasm of John Kuntz, which
      had been infesting the whole city, and especially the house next door to
      the painter&rsquo;s, which had been the dwelling of the respectable alderman who
      had degenerated into this most disreputable of moneyless vagabonds. What
      added to the consternation of all who heard of it, was the sickening
      conviction that the extreme measures which they had resorted to in order
      to free the city from the ghoul, beyond which nothing could be done, had
      been utterly unavailing, successful as they had proved in every other
      known case of the kind. For, urged as well by various horrid signs about
      his grave, which not even its close proximity to the altar could render a
      place of repose, they had opened it, had found in the body every
      peculiarity belonging to a vampire, had pulled it out with the greatest
      difficulty on account of a quite supernatural ponderosity; which rendered
      the horse which had killed him&mdash;a strong animal&mdash;all but unable
      to drag it along, and had at last, after cutting it in pieces, and
      expending on the fire two hundred and sixteen great billets, succeeded in
      conquering its incombustibleness, and reducing it to ashes. Such, at
      least, was the story which had reached the painter&rsquo;s household, and was
      believed by many; and if all this did not compel the perturbed corpse to
      rest, what more could be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Karl had reached his room, and was dressing himself, the thought
      struck him that something might be made of the report of the extreme
      weight of the body of old Kuntz, to favour the continuance of the delusion
      of Teufelsbürst, although he hardly knew yet to what use he could turn
      this delusion. He was convinced that he would have made no progress
      however long he might have remained in his house; and that he would have
      more chance of favour with Lilith if he were to meet her in any other
      circumstances whatever than those in which he invariably saw her&mdash;namely,
      surrounded by her father&rsquo;s influences, and watched by her father&rsquo;s cold
      blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was dressed, he crept down to the studio, which was now
      quiet enough, the storm being over, and the moon filling it with her
      steady shine. In the corner lay in all directions the fragments of the
      mould which his own body had formed and filled. The bag of plaster and the
      bucket of water which the painter had been using stood beside. Lottchen
      gathered all the pieces together, and then making his way to an outhouse
      where he had seen various odds and ends of rubbish lying, chose from the
      heap as many pieces of old iron and other metal as he could find. To these
      he added a few large stones from the garden. When he had got all into the
      studio, he locked the door, and proceeded to fit together the parts of the
      mould, filling up the hollow as he went on with the heaviest things he
      could get into it, and solidifying the whole by pouring in plaster; till,
      having at length completed it, and obliterated, as much as possible, the
      marks of joining, he left it to harden, with the conviction that now it
      would make a considerable impression on Teufelsbürst&rsquo;s imagination, as
      well as on his muscular sense. He then left everything else as nearly
      undisturbed as he could; and, knowing all the ways of the house, was soon
      in the street, without leaving any signs of his exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl soon found himself before the house in which his friend Höllenrachen
      resided. Knowing his studious habits, he had hoped to see his light still
      burning, nor was he disappointed. He contrived to bring him to his window,
      and a moment after, the door was cautiously opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Lottchen, where do you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the grave, Heinrich, or next door to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, and tell me all about it. We thought the old painter had made a
      model of you, and tortured you to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you were not far wrong. But get me a horn of ale, for even a
      vampire is thirsty, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vampire!&rdquo; exclaimed Heinrich, retreating a pace, and involuntarily
      putting himself upon his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hand was warm, was it not, old fellow?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Vampires are cold,
      all but the blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool I am!&rdquo; rejoined Heinrich. &ldquo;But you know we have been hearing
      such horrors lately that a fellow may be excused for shuddering a little
      when a pale-faced apparition tells him at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning that
      he is a vampire, and thirsty, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karl told him the whole story; and the mental process of regarding it for
      the sake of telling it, revealed to him pretty clearly some of the
      treatment of which he had been unconscious at the time. Heinrich was quite
      sure that his suspicions were correct. And now the question was, what was
      to be done next?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; said Heinrich, &ldquo;we must keep you out of the way for some
      time. I will represent to my landlady that you are in hiding from enemies,
      and her heart will rule her tongue. She can let you have a garret-room, I
      know; and I will do as well as I can to bear you company. We shall have
      time then to invent some plan of operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this proposal Karl agreed with hearty thanks, and soon all was
      arranged. The only conclusion they could yet arrive at was, that somehow
      or other the old demon-painter must be tamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, how fared it with Lilith? She too had no doubt that she had seen
      the body-ghost of poor Karl, and that the vampire had, according to rule,
      paid her the first visit because he loved her best. This was horrible
      enough if the vampire were not really the person he represented; but if in
      any sense it were Karl himself, at least it gave some expectation of a
      more prolonged existence than her father had taught her to look for; and
      if love anything like her mother&rsquo;s still lasted, even along with the
      habits of a vampire, there was something to hope for in the future. And
      then, though he had visited her, he had not, as far as she was aware,
      deprived her of a drop of blood. She could not be certain that he had not
      bitten her, for she had been in such a strange condition of mind that she
      might not have felt it, but she believed that he had restrained the
      impulses of his vampire nature, and had left her, lest he should yet yield
      to them. She fell fast asleep; and, when morning came, there was not, as
      far as she could judge, one of those triangular leech-like perforations to
      be found upon her whole body. Will it be believed that the moment she was
      satisfied of this, she was seized by a terrible jealousy, lest Karl should
      have gone and bitten some one else? Most people will wonder that she
      should not have gone out of her senses at once; but there was all the
      difference between a visit from a real vampire and a visit from a man she
      had begun to love, even although she took him for a vampire. All the
      difference does <i>not</i> lie in a name. They were very different causes,
      and the effects must be very different.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Teufelsbürst came down in the morning, he crept into the studio like
      a murderer. There lay the awful white block, seeming to his eyes just the
      same as he had left it. What was to be done with it? He dared not open it.
      Mould and model must go together. But whither? If inquiry should be made
      after Wolkenlicht, and this were discovered anywhere on his premises,
      would it not be enough to bring him at once to the gallows? Therefore it
      would be dangerous to bury it in the garden, or in the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; thought he, with a shudder, &ldquo;that would be to fix the vampire
      as a guest for ever.&rdquo;&mdash;And the horrors of the past night rushed back
      upon his imagination with renewed intensity. What would it be to have the
      dead Karl crawling about his house for ever, now inside, now out, now
      sitting on the stairs, now staring in at the windows?
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have dragged it to the bottom of his garden, past which the
      Moldau flowed, and plunged it into the stream; but then, should the
      spectre continue to prove troublesome, it would be almost impossible to
      reach the body so as to destroy it by fire; besides which, he could not do
      it without assistance, and the probability of discovery. If, however, the
      apparition should turn out to be no vampire, but only a respectable ghost,
      they might manage to endure its presence, till it should be weary of
      haunting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resolved at last to convey the body for the meantime into a concealed
      cellar in the house, seeing something must be done before his daughter
      came down. Proceeding to remove it, his consternation as greatly increased
      when he discovered how the body had grown in weight since he had thus
      disposed of it, leaving on his mind scarcely a hope that it could turn out
      not to be a vampire after all. He could scarcely stir it, and there was
      but one whom he could call to his assistance&mdash;the old woman who acted
      as his housekeeper and servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to her room, roused her, and told her the whole story. Devoted to
      her master for many years, and not quite so sensitive to fearful
      influences as when less experienced in horrors, she showed immediate
      readiness to render him assistance. Utterly unable, however, to lift the
      mass between them, they could only drag and push it along; and such a slow
      toil was it that there was no time to remove the traces of its track,
      before Lilith came down and saw a broad white line leading from the door
      of the studio down the cellarstairs. She knew in a moment what it meant;
      but not a word was uttered about the matter, and the name of Karl
      Wolkenlicht seemed to be entirely forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how could the affairs of a house go on all the same when every one of
      the household knew that a dead body lay in the cellar?&mdash;nay more,
      that, although it lay still and dead enough all day, it would come half
      alive at nightfall, and, turning the whole house into a sepulchre by its
      presence, go creeping about like a cat all over it in the dark&mdash;perhaps
      with phosphorescent eyes? So it was not surprising that the painter
      abandoned his studio early, and that the three found themselves together
      in the gorgeous room formerly described, as soon as twilight began to
      fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already Teufelsbürst had begun to experience a kind of shrinking from the
      horrid faces in his own pictures, and to feel disgusted at the abortions
      of his own mind. But all that he and the old woman now felt was an
      increasing fear as the night drew on, a kind of sickening and paralysing
      terror. The thing down there would not lie quiet&mdash;at least its
      phantom in the cellars of their imagination would not. As much as
      possible, however, they avoided alarming Lilith, who, knowing all they
      knew, was as silent as they. But her mind was in a strange state of
      excitement, partly from the presence of a new sense of love, the pleasure
      of which all the atmosphere of grief into which it grew could not totally
      quench. It comforted her somehow, as a child may comfort when his father
      is away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bedtime came, and no one made a move to go. Without a word spoken on the
      subject, the three remained together all night; the elders nodding and
      slumbering occasionally, and Lilith getting some share of repose on a
      couch. All night the shape of death might be somewhere about the house;
      but it did not disturb them. They heard no sound, saw no sight; and when
      the morning dawned, they separated, chilled and stupid, and for the time
      beyond fear, to seek repose in their private chambers. There they remained
      equally undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the painter approached his easel a few hours after, looking more
      pale and haggard still than he was wont, from the fears of the night, a
      new bewilderment took possession of him. He had been busy with a fresh
      embodiment of his favourite subject, into which he had sketched the form
      of the student as the sufferer. He had represented poor Wolkenlicht as
      just beginning to recover from a trance, while a group of surgeons,
      unaware of the signs of returning life, were absorbed in a minute
      dissection of one of the limbs. At an open door he had painted Lilith
      passing, with her face buried in a bunch of sweet peas. But when he came
      to the picture, he found, to his astonishment and terror, that the face of
      one of the group was now turned towards that of the victim, regarding his
      revival with demoniac satisfaction, and taking pains to prevent the others
      from discovering it. The face of this prince of torturers was that of
      Teufelsbürst himself. Lilith had altogether vanished, and in her place
      stood the dim vampire reiteration of the body that lay extended on the
      table, staring greedily at the assembled company. With trembling hands the
      painter removed the picture from the easel, and turned its face to the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this was the work of Lottchen. When he left the house, he took
      with him the key of a small private door, which was so seldom used that,
      while it remained closed, the key would not be missed, perhaps for many
      months. Watching the windows, he had chosen a safe time to enter, and had
      been hard at work all night on these alterations. Teufelsbürst attributed
      them to the vampire, and left the picture as he found it, not daring to
      put brush to it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night was passed much after the same fashion. But the fear had
      begun to die away a little in the hearts of the women, who did not know
      what had taken place in the studio on the previous night. It burrowed,
      however, with gathered force in the vitals of Teufelsbürst. But this night
      likewise passed in peace; and before it was over, the old woman had taken
      to speculating in her own mind as to the best way of disposing of the
      body, seeing it was not at all likely to be troublesome. But when the
      painter entered his studio in trepidation the next morning, he found that
      the form of the lovely Lilith was painted out of every picture in the
      room. This could not be concealed; and Lilith and the servant became aware
      that the studio was the portion of the house in haunting which the vampire
      left the rest in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl recounted all the tricks he had played to his friend Heinrich, who
      begged to be allowed to bear him company the following night. To this Karl
      consented, thinking it would be considerably more agreeable to have a
      companion. So they took a couple of bottles of wine and some provisions
      with them, and before midnight found themselves snug in the studio. They
      sat very quiet for some time, for they knew that if they were seen, two
      vampires would not be so terrible as one, and might occasion discovery.
      But at length Heinrich could bear it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Lottchen, let&rsquo;s go and look; for your dead body. What has the old
      beggar done with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know. Stop; let me peep out. All right! Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a lamp in his hand, he led the way to the cellars, and after
      searching about a little they discovered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks horrid enough,&rdquo; said Heinrich, &ldquo;but think a drop or two of wine
      would brighten it up a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he took a bottle from his pocket, and after they had had a glass
      apiece, he dropped a third in blots all over the plaster. Being red wine,
      it had the effect Höllenrachen desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they visit it next, they will know that the vampire can find the
      food he prefers,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner close by the plaster, they found the clothes Karl had worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hillo!&rdquo; said Heinrich, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make something of this find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he carried them with him to the studio. There he got hold of the
      lay-figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you about, Heinrich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to make a scarecrow to keep the ravens off old Teufel&rsquo;s pictures,&rdquo;
       answered Heinrich, as he went on dressing the lay-figure in Karl&rsquo;s
      clothes. He next seated the creature at an easel with its back to the
      door, so that it should be the first thing the painter should see when he
      entered. Karl meant to remove this before he went, for it was too comical
      to fall in with the rest of his proceedings. But the two sat down to their
      supper, and by the time they had finished the wine, they thought they
      should like to go to bed. So they got up and went home, and Karl forgot
      the lay-figure, leaving it in busy motionlessness all night before the
      easel. When Teufelsbürst saw it, he turned and fled with a cry that
      brought his daughter to his help. He rushed past her, able only to
      articulate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vampire! The vampire! Painting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Far more courageous than he, because her conscience was more peaceful,
      Lilith passed on to the studio. She too recoiled a step or two when she
      saw the figure; but with the sight of the back of Karl, as she supposed it
      to be, came the longing to see the face that was on the other side. So she
      crept round and round by the wall, as far off as she could. The figure
      remained motionless. It was a strange kind of shock that she experienced
      when she saw the face, disgusting from its inanity. The absurdity next
      struck her; and with the absurdity flashed into her mind the conviction
      that this was not the doing of a vampire; for of all creatures under the
      moon, he could not be expected to be a humorist. A wild hope sprang up in
      her mind that Karl was not dead. Of this she soon resolved to make herself
      sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the door of the studio; in the strength of her new hope
      undressed the figure, put it in its place, concealed the garments&mdash;all
      the work of a few minutes; and then, finding her father just recovering
      from the worst of his fear, told him there was nothing in the studio but
      what ought to be there, and persuaded him to go and see. He not only saw
      no one, but found that no further liberties had been taken with his
      pictures. Reassured, he soon persuaded himself that the spectre in this
      case had been the offspring of his own terror-haunted brain. But he had no
      spirit for painting now. He wandered about the house, himself haunting it
      like a restless ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      When night came, Lilith retired to her own room. The waters of fear had
      begun to subside in the house; but the painter and his old attendant did
      not yet follow her example.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon, however, as the house was quite still, Lilith glided noiselessly
      down the stairs, went into the studio, where as yet there assuredly was no
      vampire, and concealed herself in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it would not do for an earnest student like Heinrich to be away from
      his work very often, he had not asked to accompany Lottchen this time. And
      indeed Karl himself, a little anxious about the result of the scarecrow,
      greatly preferred going alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was waiting for what might happen, the conviction grew upon
      Lilith, as she reviewed all the past of the story, that these phenomena
      were the work of the real Karl, and of no vampire. In a few moments she
      was still more sure of this. Behind the screen where she had taken refuge,
      hung one of the pictures out of which her portrait had been painted the
      night before last. She had taken a lamp with her into the studio, with the
      intention of extinguishing it the moment she heard any sign of approach;
      but as the vampire lingered, she began to occupy herself with examining
      the picture beside her. She had not looked at it long, before she wetted
      the tip of her forefinger, and began to rub away at the obliteration. Her
      suspicions were instantly confirmed: the substance employed was only a
      gummy wash over the paint. The delight she experienced at the discovery
      threw her into a mischievous humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;whether I cannot match Karl
      Wolkenlicht at this game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a closet in the room hung a number of costumes, which Lilith had at
      different times worn for her father. Among them was a large white drapery,
      which she easily disposed as a shroud. With the help of some chalk, she
      soon made herself ghastly enough, and then placing her lamp on the floor
      behind the screen, and setting a chair over it, so that it should throw no
      light in any direction, she waited once more for the vampire. Nor had she
      much longer to wait. She soon heard a door move, the sound of which she
      hardly knew, and then the studio door opened. Her heart beat dreadfully,
      not with fear lest it should be a vampire after all, but with hope that it
      was Karl. To see him once more was too great joy. Would she not make up to
      him for all her coldness! But would he care for her now? Perhaps he had
      been quite cured of his longing for a hard heart like hers. She peeped. It
      was he sure enough, looking as handsome as ever. He was holding his light
      to look at her last work, and the expression of his face, even in
      regarding her handiwork, was enough to let her know that he loved her
      still. If she had not seen this, she dared not have shown herself from her
      hiding-place. Taking the lamp in her hand, she got upon the chair, and
      looked over the screen, letting the light shine from below upon her face.
      She then made a slight noise to attract Karl&rsquo;s attention. He looked up,
      evidently rather startled, and saw the face of Lilith in the air: He gave
      a stifled cry threw himself on his knees with his arms stretched towards
      her, and moaned&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have killed her! I have killed her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilith descended, and approached him noiselessly. He did not move. She
      came close to him and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Karl Wolkenlicht?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips moved, but no sound came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are a vampire, and I am a ghost,&rdquo; she said&mdash;but a low happy
      laugh alone concluded the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl sprang to his feet. Lilith&rsquo;s laugh changed into a burst of sobbing
      and weeping, and in another moment the ghost was in the arms of the
      vampire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilith had no idea how far her father had wronged Karl, and though, from
      thinking over the past, he had no doubt that the painter had drugged him,
      he did not wish to pain her by imparting this conviction. But Lilith was
      afraid of a reaction of rage and hatred in her father after the terror was
      removed; and Karl saw that he might thus be deprived of all further
      intercourse with Lilith, and all chance of softening the old man&rsquo;s heart
      towards him; while Lilith would not hear of forsaking him who had banished
      all the human race but herself. They managed at length to agree upon a
      plan of operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing they did was to go to the cellar where the plaster mass
      lay, Karl carrying with him a great axe used for cleaving wood. Lilith
      shuddered when she saw it, stained as it was with the wine Heinrich had
      spilt over it, and almost believed herself the midnight companion of a
      vampire after all, visiting with him the terrible corpse in which he lived
      all day. But Karl soon reassured her; and a few good blows of the axe
      revealed a very different core to that which Teufelsbürst supposed to be
      in it. Karl broke it into pieces, and with Lilith&rsquo;s help, who insisted on
      carrying her share, the whole was soon at the bottom of the Moldau and
      every trace of its ever having existed removed. Before morning, too, the
      form of Lilith had dawned anew in every picture. There was no time to
      restore to its former condition the one Karl had first altered; for in it
      the changes were all that they seemed; nor indeed was he capable of
      restoring it in the master&rsquo;s style; but they put it quite out of the way,
      and hoped that sufficient time might elapse before the painter thought of
      it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had done, and Lilith, for all his entreaties, would remain with
      him no longer, Karl took his former clothes with him, and having spent the
      rest of the night in his old room, dressed in them in the morning. When
      Teufelsbürst entered his studio next day, there sat Karl, as if nothing
      had happened, finishing the drawing on which he had been at work when the
      fit of insensibility came upon him. The painter started, stared, rubbed
      his eyes, thought it was another spectral illusion, and was on the point
      of yielding to his terror, when Karl rose, and approached him with a
      smile. The healthy, sunshiny countenance of Karl, let him be ghost or
      goblin, could not fail to produce somewhat of a tranquillising effect on
      Teufelsbürst. He took his offered hand mechanically, his countenance
      utterly vacant with idiotic bewilderment. Karl said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not well, and thought it better to pay a visit to a friend for a
      few days; but I shall soon make up for lost time, for I am all right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down at once, taking no notice of his master&rsquo;s behaviour, and went
      on with his drawing. Teufelsbürst stood staring at him for some minutes
      without moving, then suddenly turned and left the room. Karl heard him
      hurrying down the cellar stairs. In a few moments he came up again. Karl
      stole a glance at him. There he stood in the same spot, no doubt more full
      of bewilderment than ever, but it was not possible that his face should
      express more. At last he went to his easel, and sat down with a long-drawn
      sigh as if of relief. But though he sat at his easel, he painted none that
      day; and as often as Karl ventured a glance, he saw him still staring at
      him. The discovery that his pictures were restored to their former
      condition aided, no doubt, in leading him to the same conclusion as the
      other facts, whatever that conclusion might be&mdash;probably that he had
      been the sport of some evil power, and had been for the greater part of a
      week utterly bewitched. Lilith had taken care to instruct the old woman,
      with whom she was all-powerful; and as neither of them showed the smallest
      traces of the astonishment which seemed to be slowly vitrifying his own
      brain, he was at last perfectly satisfied that things had been going on
      all right everywhere but in his inner man; and in this conclusion he
      certainly was not far wrong, in more senses than one. But when all was
      restored again to the old routine, it became evident that the peculiar
      direction of his art in which he had hitherto indulged had ceased to
      interest him. The shock had acted chiefly upon that part of his mental
      being which had been so absorbed. He would sit for hours without doing
      anything, apparently plunged in meditation.&mdash;Several weeks elapsed
      without any change, and both Lilith and Karl were getting dreadfully
      anxious about him. Karl paid him every attention; and the old man, for he
      now looked much older than before, submitted to receive his services as
      well as those of Lilith. At length, one morning, he said in a slow
      thoughtful tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Karl Wolkenlicht, I should like to paint you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; answered Karl, jumping up, &ldquo;where would you like me to
      sit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the ice of silence and inactivity was broken, and the painter drew and
      painted; and the spring of his art flowed once more; and he made a
      beautiful portrait of Karl&mdash;a portrait without evil or suffering. And
      as soon as he had finished Karl, he began once more to paint Lilith; and
      when he had painted her, he composed a picture for the very purpose of
      introducing them together; and in this picture there was neither ugliness
      nor torture, but human feeling and human hope instead. Then Karl knew that
      he might speak to him of Lilith; and he spoke, and was heard with a smile.
      But he did not dare to tell him the truth of the vampire story till one
      day that Teufelsbürst was lying on the floor of a room in Karl&rsquo;s ancestral
      castle, half smothered in grandchildren; when the only answer it drew from
      the old man was a kind of shuddering laugh and the words &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of
      it, Karl, my boy!&rdquo;

      THE CASTLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the top of a high cliff, forming part of the base of a great mountain,
      stood a lofty castle. When or how it was built, no man knew; nor could any
      one pretend to understand its architecture. Every one who looked upon it
      felt that it was lordly and noble; and where one part seemed not to agree
      with another, the wise and modest dared not to call them incongruous, but
      presumed that the whole might be constructed on some higher principle of
      architecture than they yet understood. What helped them to this conclusion
      was, that no one had ever seen the whole of the edifice; that, even of the
      portion best known, some part or other was always wrapped in thick folds
      of mist from the mountain; and that, when the sun shone upon this mist,
      the parts of the building that appeared through the vaporous veil were
      strangely glorified in their indistinctness, so that they seemed to belong
      to some aerial abode in the land of the sunset; and the beholders could
      hardly tell whether they had ever seen them before, or whether they were
      now for the first time partially revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor, although it was inhabited, could certain information be procured as
      to its internal construction. Those who dwelt in it often discovered rooms
      they had never entered before&mdash;yea, once or twice,&mdash;whole suites
      of apartments, of which only dim legends had been handed down from former
      times. Some of them expected to find, one day, secret places, filled with
      treasures of wondrous jewels; amongst which they hoped to light upon
      Solomon&rsquo;s ring, which had for ages disappeared from the earth, but which
      had controlled the spirits, and the possession of which made a man simply
      what a man should be, the king of the world. Now and then, a narrow,
      winding stair, hitherto untrodden, would bring them forth on a new turret,
      whence new prospects of the circumjacent country were spread out before
      them. How many more of these there might be, or how much loftier, no one
      could tell. Nor could the foundations of the castle in the rock on which
      it was built be determined with the smallest approach to precision. Those
      of the family who had given themselves to exploring in that direction,
      found such a labyrinth of vaults and passages, and endless successions of
      down-going stairs, out of one underground space into a yet lower, that
      they came to the conclusion that at least the whole mountain was
      perforated and honeycombed in this fashion. They had a dim consciousness,
      too, of the presence, in those awful regions, of beings whom they could
      not comprehend. Once they came upon the brink of a great black gulf, in
      which the eye could see nothing but darkness: they recoiled with horror;
      for the conviction flashed upon them that that gulf went down into the
      very central spaces of the earth, of which they had hitherto been
      wandering only in the upper crust; nay, that the seething blackness before
      them had relations mysterious, and beyond human comprehension, with the
      far-off voids of space, into which the stars dare not enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the cliff whereon the castle stood, lay a deep lake,
      inaccessible save by a few avenues, being surrounded on all sides with
      precipices which made the water look very black, although it was pure as
      the nightsky. From a door in the castle, which was not to be otherwise
      entered, a broad flight of steps, cut in the rock, went down to the lake,
      and disappeared below its surface. Some thought the steps went to the very
      bottom of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in this castle there dwelt a large family of brothers and sisters.
      They had never seen their father or mother. The younger had been educated
      by the elder, and these by an unseen care and ministration, about the
      sources of which they had, somehow or other, troubled themselves very
      little&mdash;for what people are accustomed to, they regard as coming from
      nobody; as if help and progress and joy and love were the natural crops of
      Chaos or old Night. But Tradition said that one day&mdash;it was utterly
      uncertain <i>when</i>&mdash;their father would come, and leave them no
      more; for he was still alive, though where he lived nobody knew. In the
      meantime all the rest had to obey their eldest brother, and listen to his
      counsels.
    </p>
    <p>
      But almost all the family was very fond of liberty, as they called it; and
      liked to run up and down, hither and thither, roving about, with neither
      law nor order, just as they pleased. So they could not endure their
      brother&rsquo;s tyranny, as they called it. At one time they said that he was
      only one of themselves, and therefore they would not obey him; at another,
      that he was not like them, and could not understand them, and <i>therefore</i>
      they would not obey him. Yet, sometimes, when he came and looked them full
      in the face, they were terrified, and dared not disobey, for he was
      stately and stern and strong. Not one of them loved him heartily, except
      the eldest sister, who was very beautiful and silent, and whose eyes shone
      as if light lay somewhere deep behind them. Even she, although she loved
      him, thought him very hard sometimes; for when he had once said a thing
      plainly, he could not be persuaded to think it over again. So even she
      forgot him sometimes, and went her own ways, and enjoyed herself without
      him. Most of them regarded him as a sort of watchman, whose business it
      was to keep them in order; and so they were indignant and disliked him.
      Yet they all had a secret feeling that they ought to be subject to him;
      and after any particular act of disregard, none of them could think, with
      any peace, of the old story about the return of their father to his house.
      But indeed they never thought much about it, or about their father at all;
      for how could those who cared so little for their brother, whom they saw
      every day, care for their father whom they had never seen?&mdash;One chief
      cause of complaint against him was that he interfered with their favourite
      studies and pursuits; whereas he only sought to make them give up trifling
      with earnest things, and seek for truth, and not for amusement, from the
      many wonders around them. He did not want them to turn to other studies,
      or to eschew pleasures; but, in those studies, to seek the highest things
      most, and other things in proportion to their true worth and nobleness.
      This could not fail to be distasteful to those who did not care for what
      was higher than they. And so matters went on for a time. They thought they
      could do better without their brother; and their brother knew they could
      not do at all without him, and tried to fulfil the charge committed into
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, one day, for the thought seemed to strike them simultaneously,
      they conferred together about giving a great entertainment in their
      grandest rooms to any of their neighbours who chose to come, or indeed to
      any inhabitants of the earth or air who would visit them. They were too
      proud to reflect that some company might defile even the dwellers in what
      was undoubtedly the finest palace on the face of the earth. But what made
      the thing worse, was, that the old tradition said that these rooms were to
      be kept entirely for the use of the owner of the castle. And, indeed,
      whenever they entered them, such was the effect of their loftiness and
      grandeur upon their minds, that they always thought of the old story, and
      could not help believing it. Nor would the brother permit them to forget
      it now; but, appearing suddenly amongst them, when they had no expectation
      of being interrupted by him, he rebuked them, both for the indiscriminate
      nature of their invitation, and for the intention of introducing any one,
      not to speak of some who would doubtless make their appearance on the
      evening in question, into the rooms kept sacred for the use of the unknown
      father. But by this time their talk with each other had so excited their
      expectations of enjoyment, which had previously been strong enough, that
      anger sprung up within them at the thought of being deprived of their
      hopes, and they looked each other in the eyes; and the look said: &ldquo;We are
      many and he is one&mdash;let us get rid of him, for he is always finding
      fault, and thwarting us in the most innocent pleasures;&mdash;as if we
      would wish to do anything wrong!&rdquo; So without a word spoken, they rushed
      upon him; and although he was stronger than any of them, and struggled
      hard at first, yet they overcame him at last. Indeed some of them thought
      he yielded to their violence long before they had the mastery of him; and
      this very submission terrified the more tender-hearted amongst them.
      However, they bound him; carried him down many stairs, and, having
      remembered an iron staple in the wall of a certain vault, with a thick
      rusty chain attached to it, they bore him thither, and made the chain fast
      around him. There they left him, shutting the great gnarring brazen door
      of the vault, as they departed for the upper regions of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now all was in a tumult of preparation. Every one was talking of the
      coming festivity; but no one spoke of the deed they had done. A sudden
      paleness overspread the face, now of one, and now of another; but it
      passed away, and no one took any notice of it; they only plied the task of
      the moment the more energetically. Messengers were sent far and near, not
      to individuals or families, but publishing in all places of concourse a
      general invitation to any who chose to come on a certain day, and partake
      for certain succeeding days of the hospitality of the dwellers in the
      castle. Many were the preparations immediately begun for complying with
      the invitation. But the noblest of their neighbours refused to appear; not
      from pride, but because of the unsuitableness and carelessness of such a
      mode. With some of them it was an old condition in the tenure of their
      estates, that they should go to no one&rsquo;s dwelling except visited in
      person, and expressly solicited. Others, knowing what sort of persons
      would be there, and that, from a certain physical antipathy, they could
      scarcely breathe in their company, made up their minds at once not to go.
      Yet multitudes, many of them beautiful and innocent as well as gay,
      resolved to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the great rooms of the castle were got in readiness&mdash;that
      is, they proceeded to deface them with decorations; for there was a
      solemnity and stateliness about them in their ordinary condition, which
      was at once felt to be unsuitable for the light-hearted company so soon to
      move about in them with the self-same carelessness with which men walk
      abroad within the great heavens and hills and clouds. One day, while the
      workmen were busy, the eldest sister, of whom I have already spoken,
      happened to enter, she knew not why. Suddenly the great idea of the mighty
      halls dawned upon her, and filled her soul. The so-called decorations
      vanished from her view, and she felt as if she stood in her father&rsquo;s
      presence. She was at one elevated and humbled. As suddenly the idea faded
      and fled, and she beheld but the gaudy festoons and draperies and
      paintings which disfigured the grandeur. She wept and sped away. Now it
      was too late to interfere, and things must take their course. She would
      have been but a Cassandra-prophetess to those who saw but the pleasure
      before them. She had not been present when her brother was imprisoned; and
      indeed for some days had been so wrapt in her own business, that she had
      taken but little heed of anything that was going on. But they all expected
      her to show herself when the company was gathered; and they had applied to
      her for advice at various times during their operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the expected hour arrived, and the company began to assemble. It
      was a warm summer evening. The dark lake reflected the rose-coloured
      clouds in the west, and through the flush rowed many gaily painted boats,
      with various coloured flags, towards the massy rock on which the castle
      stood. The trees and flowers seemed already asleep, and breathing forth
      their sweet dream-breath. Laughter and low voices rose from the breast of
      the lake to the ears of the youths and maidens looking forth expectant
      from the lofty windows. They went down to the broad platform at the top of
      the stairs in front of the door to receive their visitors. By degrees the
      festivities of the evening commenced. The same smiles flew forth both at
      eyes and lips, darting like beams through the gathering crowd. Music, from
      unseen sources, now rolled in billows, now crept in ripples through the
      sea of air that filled the lofty rooms. And in the dancing halls, when
      hand took hand, and form and motion were moulded and swayed by the
      indwelling music, it governed not these alone, but, as the ruling spirit
      of the place, every new burst of music for a new dance swept before it a
      new and accordant odour, and dyed the flames that glowed in the lofty
      lamps with a new and accordant stain. The floors bent beneath the feet of
      the time-keeping dancers. But twice in the evening some of the inmates
      started, and the pallor occasionally common to the household overspread
      their faces, for they felt underneath them a counter-motion to the dance,
      as if the floor rose slightly to answer their feet. And all the time their
      brother lay below in the dungeon, like John the Baptist in the castle of
      Herod, when the lords and captains sat around, and the daughter of
      Herodias danced before them. Outside, all around the castle, brooded the
      dark night unheeded; for the clouds had come up from all sides, and were
      crowding together overhead. In the unfrequent pauses of the music, they
      might have heard, now and then, the gusty rush of a lonely wind, coming
      and going no one could know whence or whither, born and dying unexpected
      and unregarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the festivities were at their height, when the external and
      passing confidence which is produced between superficial natures by a
      common pleasure was at the full, a sudden crash of thunder quelled the
      music, as the thunder quells the noise of the uplifted sea. The windows
      were driven in, and torrents of rain, carried in the folds of a rushing
      wind, poured into the halls. The lights were swept away; and the great
      rooms, now dark within, were darkened yet more by the dazzling shoots of
      flame from the vault of blackness overhead. Those that ventured to look
      out of the windows saw, in the blue brilliancy of the quick-following jets
      of lightning, the lake at the foot of the rock, ordinarily so still and so
      dark, lighted up, not on the surface only, but down to half its depth; so
      that, as it tossed in the wind, like a tortured sea of writhing flames, or
      incandescent half-molten serpents of brass, they could not tell whether a
      strong phosphorescence did not issue from the transparent body of the
      waters, as if earth and sky lightened together, one consenting source of
      flaming utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sad was the condition of the late plastic mass of living form that had
      flowed into shape at the will and law of the music. Broken into
      individuals, the common transfusing spirit withdrawn, they stood drenched,
      cold, and benumbed, with clinging garments; light, order, harmony, purpose
      departed, and chaos restored; the issuings of life turned back on their
      sources, chilly and dead. And in every heart reigned the falsest of
      despairing convictions, that this was the only reality, and that was but a
      dream. The eldest sister stood with clasped hands and down-bent head,
      shivering and speechless, as if waiting for something to follow. Nor did
      she wait long. A terrible flash and thunder-peal made the castle rock; and
      in the pausing silence that followed, her quick sense heard the rattling
      of a chain far off, deep down; and soon the sound of heavy footsteps,
      accompanied with the clanking of iron, reached her ear. She felt that her
      brother was at hand. Even in the darkness, and amidst the bellowing of
      another deep-bosomed cloud-monster, she knew that he had entered the room.
      A moment after, a continuous pulsation of angry blue light began, which,
      lasting for some moments, revealed him standing amidst them, gaunt,
      haggard, and motionless; his hair and beard untrimmed, his face ghastly,
      his eyes large and hollow. The light seemed to gather around him as a
      centre. Indeed some believed that it throbbed and radiated from his
      person, and not from the stormy heavens above them. The lightning had rent
      the wall of his prison, and released the iron staple of his chain, which
      he had wound about him like a girdle. In his hand he carried an iron
      fetter-bar, which he had found on the floor of the vault. More terrified
      at his aspect than at all the violence of the storm, the visitors, with
      many a shriek and cry, rushed out into the tempestuous night. By degrees,
      the storm died away. Its last flash revealed the forms of the brothers and
      sisters lying prostrate, with their faces on the floor, and that fearful
      shape standing motionless amidst them still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning dawned, and there they lay, and there he stood. But at a word from
      him, they arose and went about their various duties, though listlessly
      enough. The eldest sister was the last to rise; and when she did, it was
      only by a terrible effort that she was able to reach her room, where she
      fell again on the floor. There she remained lying for days. The brother
      caused the doors of the great suite of rooms to be closed, leaving them
      just as they were, with all the childish adornment scattered about, and
      the rain still falling in through the shattered windows. &ldquo;Thus let them
      lie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;till the rain and frost have cleansed them of paint and
      drapery: no storm can hurt the pillars and arches of these halls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hours of this day went heavily. The storm was gone, but the rain was
      left; the passion had departed, but the tears remained behind. Dull and
      dark the low misty clouds brooded over the castle and the lake, and shut
      out all the neighbourhood. Even if they had climbed to the loftiest known
      turret, they would have found it swathed in a garment of clinging vapour,
      affording no refreshment to the eye, and no hope to the heart. There was
      one lofty tower that rose sheer a hundred feet above the rest, and from
      which the fog could have been seen lying in a grey mass beneath; but that
      tower they had not yet discovered, nor another close beside it, the top of
      which was never seen, nor could be, for the highest clouds of heaven
      clustered continually around it. The rain fell continuously, though not
      heavily, without; and within, too, there were clouds from which dropped
      the tears which are the rain of the spirit. All the good of life seemed
      for the time departed, and their souls lived but as leafless trees that
      had forgotten the joy of the summer, and whom no wind prophetic of spring
      had yet visited. They moved about mechanically, and had not strength
      enough left to wish to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the clouds were higher, and a little wind blew through such
      loopholes in the turrets as the false improvements of the inmates had not
      yet filled with glass, shutting out, as the storm, so the serene visitings
      of the heavens. Throughout the day, the brother took various opportunities
      of addressing a gentle command, now to one and now to another of his
      family. It was obeyed in silence. The wind blew fresher through the
      loopholes and the shattered windows of the great rooms, and found its way,
      by unknown passages, to faces and eyes hot with weeping. It cooled and
      blessed them.&mdash;When the sun arose the next day, it was in a clear
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees, everything fell into the regularity of subordination. With the
      subordination came increase of freedom. The steps of the more youthful of
      the family were heard on the stairs and in the corridors more light and
      quick than ever before. Their brother had lost the terrors of aspect
      produced by his confinement, and his commands were issued more gently, and
      oftener with a smile, than in all their previous history. By degrees his
      presence was universally felt through the house. It was no surprise to any
      one at his studies, to see him by his side when he lifted up his eyes,
      though he had not before known that he was in the room. And although some
      dread still remained, it was rapidly vanishing before the advances of a
      firm friendship. Without immediately ordering their labours, he always
      influenced them, and often altered their direction and objects. The change
      soon evident in the household was remarkable. A simpler, nobler expression
      was visible on all the countenances. The voices of the men were deeper,
      and yet seemed by their very depth more feminine than before; while the
      voices of the women were softer and sweeter, and at the same time more
      full and decided. Now the eyes had often an expression as if their sight
      was absorbed in the gaze of the inward eyes; and when the eyes of two met,
      there passed between those eyes the utterance of a conviction that both
      meant the same thing. But the change was, of course, to be seen more
      clearly, though not more evidently, in individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the brothers, for instance, was very fond of astronomy. He had his
      observatory on a lofty tower, which stood pretty clear of the others,
      towards the north and east. But hitherto, his astronomy, as he had called
      it, had been more of the character of astrology. Often, too, he might have
      been seen directing a heaven-searching telescope to catch the rapid
      transit of a fiery shooting-star, belonging altogether to the earthly
      atmosphere, and not to the serene heavens. He had to learn that the signs
      of the air are not the signs of the skies. Nay, once, his brother
      surprised him in the act of examining through his longest tube a patch of
      burning heath upon a distant hill. But now he was diligent from morning
      till night in the study of the laws of the truth that has to do with
      stars; and when the curtain of the sunlight was about to rise from before
      the heavenly worlds which it had hidden all day long, he might be seen
      preparing his instruments with that solemn countenance with which it
      becometh one to look into the mysterious harmonies of Nature. Now he
      learned what law and order and truth are, what consent and harmony mean;
      how the individual may find his own end in a higher end, where law and
      freedom mean the same thing, and the purest certainty exists without the
      slightest constraint. Thus he stood on the earth, and looked to the
      heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another, who had been much given to searching out the hollow places and
      recesses in the foundations of the castle, and who was often to be found
      with compass and ruler working away at a chart of the same which he had
      been in process of constructing, now came to the conclusion, that only by
      ascending the upper regions of his abode could he become capable of
      understanding what lay beneath; and that, in all probability, one clear
      prospect, from the top of the highest attainable turret, over the castle
      as it lay below, would reveal more of the idea of its internal
      construction, than a year spent in wandering through its subterranean
      vaults. But the fact was, that the desire to ascend wakening within him
      had made him forget what was beneath; and having laid aside his chart for
      a time at least, he was now to be met in every quarter of the upper parts,
      searching and striving upward, now in one direction, now in another; and
      seeking, as he went, the best outlooks into the clear air of outer
      realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they began to discover that they were all meditating different aspects
      of the same thing; and they brought together their various discoveries,
      and recognised the likeness between them; and the one thing often
      explained the other, and combining with it helped to a third. They grew in
      consequence more and more friendly and loving; so that every now and then
      one turned to another and said, as in surprise, &ldquo;Why, you are my brother!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Why,
      you are my sister!&rdquo; And yet they had always known it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change reached to all. One, who lived on the air of sweet sounds, and
      who was almost always to be found seated by her harp or some other
      instrument, had, till the late storm, been generally merry and playful,
      though sometimes sad. But for a long time after that, she was often found
      weeping, and playing little simple airs which she had heard in childhood&mdash;backward
      longings, followed by fresh tears. Before long, however, a new element
      manifested itself in her music. It became yet more wild, and sometimes
      retained all its sadness, but it was mingled with anticipation and hope.
      The past and the future merged in one; and while memory yet brought the
      rain-cloud, expectation threw the rainbow across its bosom&mdash;and all
      was uttered in her music, which rose and swelled, now to defiance, now to
      victory; then died in a torrent of weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the eldest sister, it was many days before she recovered from the
      shock. At length, one day, her brother came to her, took her by the hand,
      led her to an open window, and told her to seat herself by it, and look
      out. She did so; but at first saw nothing more than an unsympathising
      blaze of sunlight. But as she looked, the horizon widened out, and the
      dome of the sky ascended, till the grandeur seized upon her soul, and she
      fell on her knees and wept. Now the heavens seemed to bend lovingly over
      her, and to stretch out wide cloud-arms to embrace her; the earth lay like
      the bosom of an infinite love beneath her, and the wind kissed her cheek
      with an odour of roses. She sprang to her feet, and turned, in an agony of
      hope, expecting to behold the face of the father, but there stood only her
      brother, looking calmly though lovingly on her emotion. She turned again
      to the window. On the hilltops rested the sky: Heaven and Earth were one;
      and the prophecy awoke in her soul, that from betwixt them would the steps
      of the father approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto she had seen but Beauty; now she beheld Truth. Often had she
      looked on such clouds as these, and loved the strange ethereal curves into
      which the winds moulded them; and had smiled as her little pet sister told
      her what curious animals she saw in them, and tried to point them out to
      her. Now they were as troops of angels, jubilant over her new birth, for
      they sang, in her soul, of beauty, and truth, and love. She looked down,
      and her little sister knelt beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a curious child, with black, glittering eyes, and dark hair; at
      the mercy of every wandering wind; a frolicsome, daring girl, who laughed
      more than she smiled. She was generally in attendance on her sister, and
      was always finding and bringing her strange things. She never pulled a
      primrose, but she knew the haunts of all the orchis tribe, and brought
      from them bees and butterflies innumerable, as offerings to her sister.
      Curious moths and glow-worms were her greatest delight; and she loved the
      stars, because they were like the glow-worms. But the change had affected
      her too; for her sister saw that her eyes had lost their glittering look,
      and had become more liquid and transparent. And from that time she often
      observed that her gaiety was more gentle, her smile more frequent, her
      laugh less bell-like; and although she was as wild as ever, there was more
      elegance in her motions, and more music in her voice. And she clung to her
      sister with far greater fondness than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land reposed in the embrace of the warm summer days. The clouds of
      heaven nestled around the towers of the castle; and the hearts of its
      inmates became conscious of a warm atmosphere&mdash;of a presence of love.
      They began to feel like the children of a household, when the mother is at
      home. Their faces and forms grew daily more and more beautiful, till they
      wondered as they gazed on each other. As they walked in the gardens of the
      castle, or in the country around, they were often visited, especially the
      eldest sister, by sounds that no one heard but themselves, issuing from
      woods and waters; and by forms of love that lightened out of flowers, and
      grass, and great rocks. Now and then the young children would come in with
      a slow, stately step, and, with great eyes that looked as if they would
      devour all the creation, say that they had met the father amongst the
      trees, and that he had kissed them; &ldquo;And,&rdquo; added one of them once, &ldquo;I grew
      so big!&rdquo; But when the others went out to look, they could see no one. And
      some said it must have been the brother, who grew more and more beautiful,
      and loving, and reverend, and who had lost all traces of hardness, so that
      they wondered they could ever have thought him stern and harsh. But the
      eldest sister held her peace, and looked up, and her eyes filled with
      tears. &ldquo;Who can tell,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;but the little children know more
      about it than we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Often, at sunrise, might be heard their hymn of praise to their unseen
      father, whom they felt to be near, though they saw him not. Some words
      thereof once reached my ear through the folds of the music in which they
      floated, as in an upward snowstorm of sweet sounds. And these are some of
      the words I heard&mdash;but there was much I seemed to hear which I could
      not understand, and some things which I understood but cannot utter again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thank thee that we have a father, and not a maker; that thou hast
      begotten us, and not moulded us as images of clay; that we have come forth
      of thy heart, and have not been fashioned by thy hands. It <i>must</i> be
      so. Only the heart of a father is able to create. We rejoice in it, and
      bless thee that we know it. We thank thee for thyself. Be what thou art&mdash;our
      root and life, our beginning and end, our all in all. Come home to us.
      Thou livest; therefore we live. In thy light we see. Thou art&mdash;that
      is all our song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus they worship, and love, and wait. Their hope and expectation grow
      ever stronger and brighter, that one day, ere long, the Father will show
      Himself amongst them, and thenceforth dwell in His own house for evermore.
      What was once but an old legend has become the one desire of their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the loftiest hope is the surest of being fulfilled.

    <h2>
      THE WOW O&rsquo;RIVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elsie Scott had let her work fall on her knees, and her hands on her work,
      and was looking out of the wide, low window of her room, which was on one
      of the ground floors of the village street. Through a gap in the household
      shrubbery of fuchsias and myrtles filling the window-sill, one passing on
      the foot pavement might get a momentary glimpse of her pale face, lighted
      up with two blue eyes, over which some inward trouble had spread a faint,
      gauze-like haziness. But almost before her thoughts had had time to wander
      back to this trouble, a shout of children&rsquo;s voices, at the other end of
      the street, reached her ear. She listened a moment. A shadow of
      displeasure and pain crossed her countenance; and rising hastily, she
      betook herself to an inner apartment, and closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the sounds drew nearer; and by and by an old man, whose strange
      appearance and dress showed that he had little capacity either for good or
      evil, passed the window. His clothes were comfortable enough in quality
      and condition, for they were the annual gift of a benevolent lady in the
      neighbourhood; but, being made to accommodate his taste, both known and
      traditional, they were somewhat peculiar in cut and adornment. Both coat
      and trousers were of a dark grey cloth; but the former, which, in its
      shape, partook of the military, had a straight collar of yellow, and
      narrow cuffs of the same; while upon both sleeves, about the place where a
      corporal wears his stripes, was expressed, in the same yellow cloth, a
      somewhat singular device. It was as close an imitation of a bell, with its
      tongue hanging out of its mouth, as the tailor&rsquo;s skill could produce from
      a single piece of cloth. The origin of the military cut of his coat was
      well known. His preference for it arose in the time of the wars of the
      first Napoleon, when the threatened invasion of the country caused the
      organisation of many volunteer regiments. The martial show and exercises
      captivated the poor man&rsquo;s fancy; and from that time forward nothing
      pleased his vanity, and consequently conciliated his goodwill more, than
      to style him by his favourite title&mdash;the <i>Colonel</i>. But the
      badge on his arm had a deeper origin, which will be partially manifest in
      the course of the story&mdash;if story it can be called. It was, indeed,
      the baptism of the fool, the outward and visible sign of his relation to
      the infinite and unseen. His countenance, however, although the features
      were not of any peculiarly low or animal type, showed no corresponding
      sign of the consciousness of such a relation, being as vacant as human
      countenance could well be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of Elsie&rsquo;s annoyance was that the fool was annoyed; he was
      followed by a troop of boys, who turned his rank into scorn, and assailed
      him with epithets hateful to him. Although the most harmless of creatures
      when left alone, he was dangerous when roused; and now he stooped
      repeatedly to pick up stones and hurl them at his tormentors, who took
      care, while abusing him, to keep at a considerable distance, lest he
      should get hold of them. Amidst the sounds of derision that followed him,
      might be heard the words frequently repeated&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Come hame, come
      hame</i>.&rdquo; But in a few minutes the noise ceased, either from the
      interference of some friendly inhabitant, or that the boys grew weary, and
      departed in search of other amusement. By and by, Elsie might be seen
      again at her work in the window; but the cloud over her eyes was deeper,
      and her whole face more sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, so much did the persecution of this poor man affect her, that an
      onlooker would have been compelled to seek the cause in some yet deeper
      sympathy than that commonly felt for the oppressed, even by women. And
      such a sympathy existed, strange as it may seem, between the beautiful
      girl (for many called her <i>a bonnie lassie</i>) and this &ldquo;tatter of
      humanity&rdquo;. Nothing would have been farther from the thoughts of those that
      knew them, than the supposition of any correspondence or connection
      between them; yet this sympathy sprang in part from a real similarity in
      their history and present condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the facts that were known about <i>Feel Jock&rsquo;s</i> origin were these:
      that seventy years ago, a man who had gone with his horse and cart some
      miles from the village, to fetch home a load of peat from a desolate <i>moss</i>,
      had heard, while toiling along as rough a road on as lonely a hillside as
      any in Scotland, the cry of a child; and, searching about, had found the
      infant, hardly wrapt in rags, and untended, as if the earth herself had
      just given birth&mdash;that desert moor, wide and dismal, broken and
      watery, the only bosom for him to lie upon, and the cold, clear
      night-heaven his only covering. The man had brought him home, and the
      parish had taken parish-care of him. He had grown up, and proved what he
      now was&mdash;almost an idiot. Many of the townspeople were kind to him,
      and employed him in fetching water for them from the river or wells in the
      neighbourhood, paying him for his trouble in victuals, or whisky, of which
      he was very fond. He seldom spoke; and the sentences he could utter were
      few; yet the tone, and even the words of his limited vocabulary, were
      sufficient to express gratitude and some measure of love towards those who
      were kind to him, and hatred of those who teased and insulted him. He
      lived a life without aim, and apparently to no purpose; in this resembling
      most of his more gifted fellow-men, who, with all the tools and materials
      necessary for building a noble mansion, are yet content with a clay hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie, on the contrary, had been born in a comfortable farmhouse, amidst
      homeliness and abundance. But at a very early age she had lost both father
      and mother; not so early, however, but that she had faint memories of warm
      soft times on her mother&rsquo;s bosom, and of refuge in her mother&rsquo;s arms from
      the attacks of geese, and the pursuit of pigs. Therefore, in after-times,
      when she looked forward to heaven, it was as much a reverting to the old
      heavenly times of childhood and mother&rsquo;s love, as an anticipation of
      something yet to be revealed. Indeed, without some such memory, how should
      we ever picture to ourselves a perfect rest? But sometimes it would seem
      as if the more a heart was made capable of loving, the less it had to
      love; and poor Elsie, in passing from a mother&rsquo;s to a brother&rsquo;s
      guardianship, felt a change of spiritual temperature too keen. He was not
      a bad man, or incapable of benevolence when touched by the sight of want
      in anything of which he would himself have felt the privation; but he was
      so coarsely made that only the purest animal necessities affected him, and
      a hard word, or unfeeling speech, could never have reached the quick of
      his nature through the hide that enclosed it. Elsie, on the contrary, was
      excessively and painfully sensitive, as if her nature constantly portended
      an invisible multitude of half-spiritual, half-nervous antenna, which
      shrank and trembled in every current of air at all below their own
      temperature. The effect of this upon her behaviour was such that she was
      called odd; and the poor girl felt she was not like other people, yet
      could not help it. Her brother, too, laughed at her without the slightest
      idea of the pain he occasioned, or the remotest feeling of curiosity as to
      what the inward and consistent causes of the outward abnormal condition
      might be. Tenderness was the divine comforting she needed; and it was
      altogether absent from her brother&rsquo;s character and behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her neighbours looked on her with some interest, but they rather shunned
      than courted her acquaintance; especially after the return of certain
      nervous attacks, to which she had been subject in childhood, and which
      were again brought on by the events I must relate. It is curious how
      certain diseases repel, by a kind of awe, the sympathies of the
      neighbours: as if, by the fact of being subject to them, the patient were
      removed into another realm of existence, from which, like the dead with
      the living, she can hold communion with those around her only partially,
      and with a mixture of dread pervading the intercourse. Thus some of the
      deepest, purest wells of spiritual life, are, like those in old castles,
      choked up by the decay of the outer walls. But what tended more than
      anything, perhaps, to keep up the painful unrest of her soul (for the
      beauty of her character was evident in the fact that the irritation seldom
      reached her <i>mind</i>), was a circumstance at which, in its present
      connection, some of my readers will smile, and others feel a shudder
      corresponding in kind to that of Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother was very fond of a rather small, but ferocious-looking
      bull-dog, which followed close at his heels, wherever he went, with
      hanging head and slouching gait, never leaping or racing about like other
      dogs. When in the house, he always lay under his master&rsquo;s chair. He seemed
      to dislike Elsie, and she felt an unspeakable repugnance to him. Though
      she never mentioned her aversion, her brother easily saw it by the way in
      which she avoided the animal; and attributing it entirely to fear&mdash;which
      indeed had a great share in the matter&mdash;he would cruelly aggravate
      it, by telling her stories of the fierce hardihood and relentless
      persistency of this kind of animal. He dared not yet further increase her
      terror by offering to set the creature upon her, because it was doubtful
      whether he might be able to restrain him; but the mental suffering which
      he occasioned by this heartless conduct, and for which he had no sympathy,
      was as severe as many bodily sufferings to which he would have been sorry
      to subject her. Whenever the poor girl happened inadvertently to pass near
      the dog, which was seldom, a low growl made her aware of his proximity,
      and drove her to a quick retreat. He was, in fact, the animal
      impersonation of the animal opposition which she had continually to
      endure. Like chooses like; and the bulldog <i>in</i> her brother made
      choice of the bull-dog <i>out of</i> him for his companion. So her day was
      one of shrinking fear and multiform discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a nature capable of so much distress, must of necessity be <i>capable</i>
      of a corresponding amount of pleasure; and in her case this was manifest
      in the fact that sleep and the quiet of her own room restored her
      wonderfully. If she were only let alone, a calm mood, filled with images
      of pleasure, soon took possession of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her acquaintance with the fool had commenced some ten years previous to
      the time I write of, when she was quite a little girl, and had come from
      the country with her brother, who, having taken a small farm close to the
      town, preferred residing in the town to occupying the farmhouse, which was
      not comfortable. She looked at first with some terror on his uncouth
      appearance, and with much wonderment on his strange dress. This wonder was
      heightened by a conversation she overheard one day in the street, between
      the fool and a little pale-faced boy, who, approaching him respectfully,
      said, &ldquo;Weel, cornel!&rdquo; &ldquo;Weel, laddie!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Fat dis the wow say,
      cornel?&rdquo; &ldquo;Come hame, come hame!&rdquo; answered the <i>colonel</i>, with both
      accent and quantity heaped on the word <i>hame</i>. What the wow could be,
      she had no idea; only, as the years passed on, the strange word became in
      her mind indescribably associated with the strange shape in yellow cloth
      on his sleeves. Had she been a native of the town, she could not have
      failed to know its import, so familiar was every one with it, although it
      did not belong to the local vocabulary; but, as it was, years passed away
      before she discovered its meaning. And when, again and again, the fool,
      attempting to convey his gratitude for some kindness she had shown him
      mumbled over the words&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The wow o&rsquo; Rivven&mdash;the wow o&rsquo; 
      Rivven,</i>&rdquo; the wonder would return as to what could be the idea
      associated with them in his mind, but she made no advance towards their
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That, however, which most attracted her to the old man, was his
      persecution by the children. They were to him what the bull-dog was to her&mdash;the
      constant source of irritation and annoyance. They could hardly hurt him,
      nor did he appear to dread other injury from them than insult, to which,
      fool though he was, he was keenly alive. Human gadflies that they were!
      they sometimes stung him beyond endurance, and he would curse them in the
      impotence of his anger. Once or twice Elsie had been so far carried beyond
      her constitutional timidity, by sympathy for the distress of her friend,
      that she had gone out and talked to the boys&mdash;even scolded them, so
      that they slunk away ashamed, and began to stand as much in dread of her
      as of the clutches of their prey. So she, gentle and timid to excess,
      acquired among them the reputation of a termagant. Popular opinion among
      children, as among men, is of ten just, but as often very unjust; for the
      same manifestations may proceed from opposite principles; and, therefore,
      as indices to character, may mislead as often as enlighten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next door to the house in which Elsie resided, dwelt a tradesman and his
      wife, who kept an indefinite sort of shop, in which various kinds of goods
      were exposed for sale. Their youngest son was about the same age as Elsie;
      and while they were rather more than children, and less than young people,
      he spent many of his evenings with her, somewhat to the loss of position
      in his classes at the parish school. They were, indeed, much attached to
      each other; and, peculiarly constituted as Elsie was, one may imagine what
      kind of heavenly messenger a companion stronger than herself must have
      been to her. In fact, if she could have framed the undefinable need of her
      childlike nature into an articulate prayer, it would have been&mdash;&ldquo;Give
      me some one to love me stronger than I.&rdquo; Any love was helpful, yes, in its
      degree, saving to her poor troubled soul; but the hope, as they grew older
      together, that the powerful, yet tender-hearted youth, really loved her,
      and would one day make her his wife, was like the opening of heavenly eyes
      of life and love in the hitherto blank and deathlike face of her
      existence. But nothing had been said of love, although they met and parted
      like lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless, if the circles of their thought and feeling had continued as
      now to intersect each other, there would have been no interruption to
      their affection; but the time at length arrived when the old couple,
      seeing the rest of their family comfortably settled in life, resolved to
      make a gentleman of the youngest; and so sent him from school to college.
      The facilities existing in Scotland for providing a professional training
      enabled them to educate him as a surgeon. He parted from Elsie with some
      regret; but, far less dependent on her than she was on him, and full of
      the prospects of the future, he felt none of that sinking at the heart
      which seemed to lay her whole nature open to a fresh inroad of all the
      terrors and sorrows of her peculiar existence. No correspondence took
      place between them. New pursuits and relations, and the development of his
      tastes and judgments, entirely altered the position of poor Elsie in his
      memory. Having been, during their intercourse, far less of a man than she
      of a woman, he had no definite idea of the place he had occupied in her
      regard; and in his mind she receded into the background of the past,
      without his having any idea that she would suffer thereby, or that he was
      unjust towards her; while, in her thoughts, his image stood in the highest
      and clearest relief. It was the centre-point from which and towards which
      all lines radiated and converged; and although she could not but be
      doubtful about the future, yet there was much hope mingled with her
      doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when, at the close of two years, he visited his native village, and
      she saw before her, instead of the homely youth who had left her that
      winter evening, one who, to her inexperienced eyes, appeared a finished
      gentleman, her heart sank within her, as if she had found Nature herself
      false in her ripening processes, destroying the beautiful promise of a
      former year by changing instead of developing her creations. He spoke
      kindly to her, but not cordially. To her ear the voice seemed to come from
      a great distance out of the past; and while she looked upon him, that
      optical change passed over her vision, which all have experienced after
      gazing abstractedly on any object for a time: his form grew very small,
      and receded to an immeasurable distance; till, her imagination mingling
      with the twilight haze of her senses, she seemed to see him standing far
      off on a hill, with the bright horizon of sunset for a background to his
      clearly defined figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew no more till she found herself in bed in the dark; and the first
      message that reached her from the outer world was the infernal growl of
      the bull-dog from the room below. Next day she saw her lover walking with
      two ladies, who would have thought it some degree of condescension to
      speak to her; and he passed the house without once looking towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One who is sufficiently possessed by the demon of nervousness to be glad
      of the magnetic influences of a friend&rsquo;s company in a public promenade, or
      of a horse beneath him in passing through a churchyard, will have some
      faint idea of how utterly exposed and defenceless poor Elsie now felt on
      the crowded thoroughfare of life. And so the insensibility which had
      overtaken her, was not the ordinary swoon with which Nature relieves the
      overstrained nerves, but the return of the epileptic fits of her early
      childhood; and if the condition of the poor girl had been pitiable before,
      it was tenfold more so now. Yet she did not complain, but bore all in
      silence, though it was evident that her health was giving way. But now,
      help came to her from a strange quarter; though many might not be willing
      to accord the name of help to that which rather hastened than retarded the
      progress of her decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gone to spend a few of the summer days with a relative in the
      country, some miles from her home, if home it could be called. One
      evening, towards sunset, she went out for a solitary walk. Passing from
      the little garden gate, she went along a bare country road for some
      distance, and then, turning aside by a footpath through a thicket of low
      trees, she came out in a lonely little churchyard on the hillside. Hardly
      knowing whether or not she had intended to go there, she seated herself on
      a mound covered with long grass, one of many. Before her stood the ruins
      of an old church which was taking centuries to crumble. Little remained
      but the gable wall, immensely thick, and covered with ancient ivy. The
      rays of the setting sun fell on a mound at its foot, not green like the
      rest, but of a rich red-brown in the rosy sunset, and evidently but newly
      heaped up. Her eyes, too, rested upon it. Slowly the sun sank below the
      near horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the last brilliant point disappeared, the ivy darkened, and a wind
      arose and shook all its leaves, making them look cold and troubled; and to
      Elsie&rsquo;s ear came a low faint sound, as from a far-off bell. But close
      beside her&mdash;and she started and shivered at the sound&mdash;rose a
      deep, monotonous, almost sepulchral voice, &ldquo;<i>Come hame, come hame! The
      wow, the wow</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once she understood the whole. She sat in the churchyard of the ancient
      parish church of Ruthven; and when she lifted up her eyes, there she saw,
      in the half-ruined belfry, the old bell, all but hidden with ivy, which
      the passing wind had roused to utter one sleepy tone; and there beside
      her, stood the fool with the bell on his arm; and to him and to her the <i>wow
      o&rsquo; Rivven</i> said, &ldquo;<i>Come hame, come hame</i>!&rdquo; Ah, what did she want
      in the whole universe of God but a home? And though the ground beneath was
      hard, and the sky overhead far and boundless, and the hillside lonely and
      companionless, yet somewhere within the visible and beyond these the outer
      surface of creation, there might be a home for her; as round the wintry
      house the snows lie heaped up cold and white and dreary all the long <i>forenight</i>,
      while within, beyond the closed shutters, and giving no glimmer through
      the thick stone wall, the fires are blazing joyously, and the voice and
      laughter of young unfrozen children are heard, and nothing belongs to
      winter but the grey hairs on the heads of the parents, within whose warm
      hearts childlike voices are heard, and childlike thoughts move to and fro.
      The kernel of winter itself is spring, or a sleeping summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no wonder that the fool, cast out of the earth on a far more
      desolate spot than this, should seek to return within her bosom at this
      place of open doors, and should call it <i>home</i>. For surely the
      surface of the earth had no home for him. The mound at the foot of the
      gable contained the body of one who had shown him kindness. He had
      followed the funeral that afternoon from the town, and had remained behind
      with the bell. Indeed it was his custom, though Elsie had not known it, to
      follow every funeral going to this, his favourite churchyard of Ruthven;
      and, possibly in imitation of its booming, for it was still tolled at the
      funerals, he had given the old bell the name of <i>the wow</i>, and had
      translated its monotonous clangour into the articulate sounds&mdash;<i>come
      hame, come hame</i>. What precise meaning he attached to the words, it is
      impossible to say; but it was evident that the place possessed a strange
      attraction for him, drawing him towards it by the cords of some spiritual
      magnetism. It is possible that in the mind of the idiot there may have
      been some feeling about this churchyard and bell, which, in the mind of
      another, would have become a grand poetic thought; a feeling as if the
      ghostly old bell hung at the church door of the invisible world, and ever
      and anon rung out joyous notes (though they sounded sad in the ears of the
      living), calling to the children of the unseen to <i>come home, come home</i>.
      She sat for some time in silence; for the bell did not ring again, and the
      fool spoke no more; till the dews began to fall, when she rose and went
      home, followed by her companion, who passed the night in the barn. From
      that hour Elsie was furnished with a visual image of the rest she sought;
      an image which, mingling with deeper and holier thoughts, became, like the
      bow set in the cloud, the earthly pledge and sign of the fulfilment of
      heavenly hopes. Often when the wintry fog of cold discomfort and
      homelessness filled her soul, all at once the picture of the little
      churchyard&mdash;with the old gable and belfry, and the slanting sunlight
      steeping down to the very roots of the long grass on the graves&mdash;arose
      in the darkened chamber (<i>camera obscura,</i>) of her soul; and again
      she heard the faint Aeolian sound of the bell, and the voice of the
      prophet-fool who interpreted the oracle; and the inward weariness was
      soothed by the promise of a long sleep. Who can tell how many have been
      counted fools simply because they were prophets; or how much of the
      madness in the world may be the utterance of thoughts true and just, but
      belonging to a region differing from ours in its nature and scenery!
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Elsie looking out of her window came the mocking tones of the idle
      boys who had chosen as the vehicle of their scorn the very words which
      showed the relation of the fool to the eternal, and revealed in him an
      element higher far than any yet developed in them. They turned his glory
      into shame, like the enemies of David when they mocked the would-be king.
      And the best in a man is often that which is most condemned by those who
      have not attained to his goodness. The words, however, even as repeated by
      the boys, had not solely awakened indignation at the persecution of the
      old man: they had likewise comforted her with the thought of the refuge
      that awaited both him and her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the same evening a worse trial was in store for her. Again she sat
      near the window, oppressed by the consciousness that her brother had come
      in. He had gone upstairs, and his dog had remained at the door, exchanging
      surly compliments with some of his own kind, when the fool came strolling
      past, and, I do not know from what cause, the dog flew at him. Elsie heard
      his cry and looked up. Her fear of the brute vanished in a moment before
      her sympathy for her friend. She darted from the house, and rushed towards
      the dog to drag him off the defenceless idiot, calling him by his name in
      a tone of anger and dislike. He left the fool, and, springing at Elsie,
      seized her by the arm above the elbow with such a grip that, in the midst
      of her agony, she fancied she heard the bone crack. But she uttered no
      cry, for the most apprehensive are sometimes the most courageous. Just
      then, however, her former lover was coming along the street, and, catching
      a glimpse of what had happened, was on the spot in an instant, took the
      dog by the throat with a gripe not inferior to his own, and having thus
      compelled him to relax his hold, dashed him on the ground with a force
      that almost stunned him, and then with a superadded kick sent him away
      limping and howling; whereupon the fool, attacking him furiously with a
      stick, would certainly have finished him, had not his master descried his
      plight and come to his rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the young surgeon had carried Elsie into the house; for, as soon
      as she was rescued from the dog, she had fallen down in one of her fits,
      which were becoming more and more frequent of themselves, and little
      needed such a shock as this to increase their violence. He was dressing
      her arm when she began to recover; and when she opened her eyes, in a
      state of half-consciousness, he first object she beheld was his face
      bending over her. Recalling nothing of what had occurred, it seemed to
      her, in the dreamy condition in which the fit had left her, the same face,
      unchanged, which had once shone in upon her tardy springtime, and promised
      to ripen it into summer. She forgot it had departed and left her in the
      wintry cold. And so she uttered wild words of love and trust; and the
      youth, while stung with remorse at his own neglect, was astonished to
      perceive the poetic forms of beauty in which the soul of the uneducated
      maiden burst into flower. But as her senses recovered themselves, the face
      gradually changed to her, as if the slow alteration of two years had been
      phantasmagorically compressed into a few moments; and the glow departed
      from the maiden&rsquo;s thoughts and words, and her soul found itself at the
      narrow window of the present, from which she could behold but a dreary
      country.&mdash;From the street came the iambic cry of the fool, <i>&ldquo;Come
      hame, come hame.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tycho Brahe, I think, is said to have kept a fool, who frequently sat at
      his feet in his study, and to whose mutterings he used to listen in the
      pauses of his own thought. The shining soul of the astronomer drew forth
      the rainbow of harmony from the misty spray of words ascending ever from
      the dark gulf into which the thoughts of the idiot were ever falling. He
      beheld curious concurrences of words therein; and could read strange
      meanings from them&mdash;sometimes even received wondrous hints for the
      direction of celestial inquiry, from what, to any other, and it may be to
      the fool himself, was but a ceaseless and aimless babble. Such power lieth
      in words. It is not then to be wondered at, that the sounds I have
      mentioned should fall on the ears of Elsie, at such a moment, as a message
      from God Himself. This then&mdash;all this dreariness&mdash;was but a
      passing show like the rest, and there lay somewhere for her a reality&mdash;a
      home. The tears burst up from her oppressed heart. She received the
      message, and prepared to go home. From that time her strength gradually
      sank, but her spirits as steadily rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strength of the fool, too, began to fail, for he was old. He bore all
      the signs of age, even to the grey hairs, which betokened no wisdom. But
      one cannot say what wisdom might be in him, or how far he had fought his
      own battle, and been victorious. Whether any notion of a continuance of
      life and thought dwelt in his brain, it is impossible to tell; but he
      seemed to have the idea that this was not his home; and those who saw him
      gradually approaching his end, might well anticipate for him a higher life
      in the world to come. He had passed through this world without ever
      awaking to such a consciousness of being as is common to mankind. He had
      spent his years like a weary dream through a long night&mdash;a strange,
      dismal, unkindly dream; and now the morning was at hand. Often in his
      dream had he listened with sleepy senses to the ringing of the bell, but
      that bell would awake him at last. He was like a seed buried too deep in
      the soil, to which the light has never penetrated, and which, therefore,
      has never forced its way upwards to the open air, ever experienced the
      resurrection of the dead. But seeds will grow ages after they have fallen
      into the earth; and, indeed, with many kinds, and within some limits, the
      older the seed before it germinates, the more plentiful the fruit. And may
      it not be believed of many human beings, that, the Great Husbandman having
      sown them like seeds in the soil of human affairs, there they lie buried a
      life long; and only after the upturning of the soil by death reach a
      position in which the awakening of their aspiration and the consequent
      growth become possible. Surely He has made nothing in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent cold and cough brought him at last near to his end, and hearing
      that he was ill, Elsie ventured one bright spring day to go to see him.
      When she entered the miserable room where he lay, he held out his hand to
      her with something like a smile, and muttered feebly and painfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      gaein&rsquo; to the wow, nae to come back again.&rdquo; Elsie could not restrain her
      tears; while the old man, looking fixedly at her, though with meaningless
      eyes, muttered, for the last time, &ldquo;<i>Come hame! come hame!</i>&rdquo; and sank
      into a lethargy, from which nothing could rouse him, till, next morning,
      he was waked by friendly death from the long sleep of this world&rsquo;s night.
      They bore him to his favourite churchyard, and buried him within the site
      of the old church, below his loved bell, which had ever been to him as the
      cuckoo-note of a coming spring. Thus he at length obeyed its summons, and
      went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie lingered till the first summer days lay warm on the land. Several
      kind hearts in the village, hearing of her illness, visited her and
      ministered to her. Wondering at her sweetness and patience, they regretted
      they had not known her before. How much consolation might not their
      kindness have imparted, and how much might not their sympathy have
      strengthened her on her painful road! But they could not long have delayed
      her going home. Nor, mentally constituted as she was, would this have been
      at all to be desired. Indeed it was chiefly the expectation of departure
      that quieted and soothed her tremulous nature. It is true that a deep
      spring of hope and faith kept singing on in her heart, but this alone,
      without the anticipation of speedy release, could only have kept her mind
      at peace. It could not have reached, at least for a long time, the border
      land between body and mind, in which her disease lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      One still night of summer, the nurse who watched by her bedside heard her
      murmur through her sleep, &ldquo;I hear it: <i>come hame&mdash;come hame</i>.
      I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m gaein&rsquo; hame to the wow, nae to come
      back.&rdquo; She awoke at the sound of her own words, and begged the nurse to
      convey to her brother her last request, that she might be buried by the
      side of the fool, within the old church of Ruthven. Then she turned her
      face to the wall, and in the morning was found quiet and cold. She must
      have died within a few minutes after her last words. She was buried
      according to her request; and thus she too went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side rest the aged fool and the young maiden; for the bell called
      them, and they obeyed; and surely they found the fire burning bright, and
      heard friendly voices, and felt sweet lips on theirs, in the home to which
      they went. Surely both intellect and love were waiting them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the old bell hangs in the old gable; and whenever another is borne
      to the old churchyard, it keeps calling to those who are left behind, with
      the same sad, but friendly and unchanging voice&mdash;<i>&ldquo;Come hame! come
      hame! come hame!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself:
      for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy
      mourning shall be ended.&rdquo;&mdash;ISA. LX 20.

    <h2>
      THE BROKEN SWORDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The eyes of three, two sisters and a brother, gazed for the last time on a
      great pale-golden star, that followed the sun down the steep west. It went
      down to arise again; and the brother about to depart might return, but
      more than the usual doubt hung upon his future. For between the white
      dresses of the sisters, shone his scarlet coat and golden sword-knot,
      which he had put on for the first time, more to gratify their pride than
      his own vanity. The brightening moon, as if prophetic of a future memory,
      had already begun to dim the scarlet and the gold, and to give them a
      pale, ghostly hue. In her thoughtful light the whole group seemed more
      like a meeting in the land of shadows, than a parting in the substantial
      earth. But which should be called the land of realities?&mdash;the region
      where appearance, and space, and time drive between, and stop the flowing
      currents of the soul&rsquo;s speech? or that region where heart meets heart, and
      appearance has become the slave to utterance, and space and time are
      forgotten?
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the quiet air came the far-off rush of water, and the near cry of
      the land-rail. Now and then a chilly wind blew unheeded through the
      startled and jostling leaves that shaded the ivy-seat. Else, there was
      calm everywhere, rendered yet deeper and more intense by the dusky sorrow
      that filled their hearts. For, far away, hundreds of miles beyond the
      hearing of their ears, roared the great war-guns; next week their brother
      must sail with his regiment to join the army; and tomorrow he must leave
      his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters looked on him tenderly, with vague fears about his fate. Yet
      little they divined it. That the face they loved might lie pale and
      bloody, in a heap of slain, was the worst image of it that arose before
      them; but this, had they seen the future, they would, in ignorance of the
      further future, have infinitely preferred to that which awaited him. And
      even while they looked on him, a dim feeling of the unsuitableness of his
      lot filled their minds. For, indeed, to all judgments it must have seemed
      unsuitable that the home-boy, the loved of his mother, the pet of his
      sisters, who was happy womanlike (as Coleridge says), if he possessed the
      signs of love, having never yet sought for its proofs&mdash;that he should
      be sent amongst soldiers, to command and be commanded; to kill, or perhaps
      to be himself crushed out of the fair earth in the uproar that brings back
      for the moment the reign of Night and Chaos. No wonder that to his sisters
      it seemed strange and sad. Yet such was their own position in the battle
      of life, in which their father had died with doubtful conquest, that when
      their old military uncle sent the boy an ensign&rsquo;s commission, they did not
      dream of refusing the only path open, as they thought, to an honourable
      profession, even though it might lead to the trench-grave. They heard it
      as the voice of destiny, wept, and yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they had possessed a deeper insight into his character, they would have
      discovered yet further reason to doubt the fitness of the profession
      chosen for him; and if they had ever seen him at school, it is possible
      the doubt of fitness might have strengthened into a certainty of
      incongruity. His comparative inactivity amongst his schoolfellows, though
      occasioned by no dulness of intellect, might have suggested the necessity
      of a quiet life, if inclination and liking had been the arbiters in the
      choice. Nor was this inactivity the result of defective animal spirits
      either, for sometimes his mirth and boyish frolic were unbounded; but it
      seemed to proceed from an over-activity of the inward life, absorbing, and
      in some measure checking, the outward manifestation. He had so much to do
      in his own hidden kingdom, that he had not time to take his place in the
      polity and strife of the commonwealth around him. Hence, while other boys
      were acting, he was thinking. In this point of difference, he felt keenly
      the superiority of many of his companions; for another boy would have the
      obstacle overcome, or the adversary subdued, while he was meditating on
      the propriety, or on the means, of effecting the desired end. He envied
      their promptitude, while they never saw reason to envy his wisdom; for his
      conscience, tender and not strong, frequently transformed slowness of
      determination into irresolution: while a delicacy of the sympathetic
      nerves tended to distract him from any predetermined course, by the
      diversity of their vibrations, responsive to influences from all quarters,
      and destructive to unity of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of such a one, the <i>a priori</i> judgment would be, that he ought to be
      left to meditate and grow for some time, before being called upon to
      produce the fruits of action. But add to these mental conditions a vivid
      imagination, and a high sense of honour, nourished in childhood by the
      reading of the old knightly romances, and then put the youth in a position
      in which action is imperative, and you have elements of strife sufficient
      to reduce that fair kingdom of his to utter anarchy and madness. Yet so
      little, do we know ourselves, and so different are the symbols with which
      the imagination works its algebra, from the realities which those symbols
      represent, that as yet the youth felt no uneasiness, but contemplated his
      new calling with a glad enthusiasm and some vanity; for all his prospect
      lay in the glow of the scarlet and the gold. Nor did this excitement
      receive any check till the day before his departure, on which day I have
      introduced him to my readers, when, accidently taking up a newspaper of a
      week old, his eye fell on these words&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Already crying women are
      to be met in the streets</i>.&rdquo; With this cloud afar on his horizon, which,
      though no bigger than a man&rsquo;s hand, yet cast a perceptible shadow over his
      mind, he departed next morning. The coach carried him beyond the
      consecrated circle of home laws and impulses, out into the great tumult,
      above which rises ever and anon the cry of Cain, &ldquo;Am I my brother&rsquo;s
      keeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every tragedy of higher order, constructed in Christian times, will
      correspond more or less to the grand drama of the Bible; wherein the first
      act opens with a brilliant sunset vision of Paradise, in which childish
      sense and need are served with all the profusion of the indulgent nurse.
      But the glory fades off into grey and black, and night settles down upon
      the heart which, rightly uncontent with the childish, and not having yet
      learned the childlike, seeks knowledge and manhood as a thing denied by
      the Maker, and yet to be gained by the creature; so sets forth alone to
      climb the heavens, and instead of climbing, falls into the abyss. Then
      follows the long dismal night of feverish efforts and delirious visions,
      or, it may be, helpless despair; till at length a deeper stratum of the
      soul is heaved to the surface; and amid the first dawn of morning, the
      youth says within him, &ldquo;I have sinned against my <i>Maker</i>&mdash;I will
      arise and go to my <i>Father</i>.&rdquo; More or less, I say, will Christian
      tragedy correspond to this&mdash;a fall and a rising again; not a rising
      only, but a victory; not a victory merely, but a triumph. Such, in its way
      and degree, is my story. I have shown, in one passing scene, the home
      paradise; now I have to show a scene of a far differing nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ensign was lying in his tent, weary, but wakeful. All day long
      the cannon had been bellowing against the walls of the city, which now lay
      with wide, gaping breach, ready for the morrow&rsquo;s storm, but covered yet
      with the friendly darkness. His regiment was ordered to be ready with the
      earliest dawn to march up to the breach. That day, for the first time,
      there had been blood on his sword&mdash;there the sword lay, a spot on the
      chased hilt still. He had cut down one of the enemy in a skirmish with a
      sally party of the besieged and the look of the man as he fell, haunted
      him. He felt, for the time, that he dared not pray to the Father, for the
      blood of a brother had rushed forth at the stroke of his arm, and there
      was one fewer of living souls on the earth because he lived thereon. And
      to-morrow he must lead a troop of men up to that poor disabled town, and
      turn them loose upon it, not knowing what might follow in the triumph of
      enraged and victorious foes, who for weeks had been subjected, by the
      constancy of the place, to the greatest privations. It was true the
      general had issued his commands against all disorder and pillage; but if
      the soldiers once yielded to temptation, what might not be done before the
      officers could reclaim them! All the wretched tales he had read of the
      sack of cities rushed back on his memory. He shuddered as he lay. Then his
      conscience began to speak, and to ask what right he had to be there.&mdash;Was
      the war a just one?&mdash;He could not tell; for this was a bad time for
      settling nice questions. But there he was, right or wrong, fighting and
      shedding blood on God&rsquo;s earth, beneath God&rsquo;s heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over and over he turned the question in his mind; again and again the
      spouting blood of his foe, and the death-look in his eye, rose before him;
      and the youth who at school could never fight with a companion because he
      was not sure that he was in the right, was alone in the midst of
      undoubting men of war, amongst whom he was driven helplessly along, upon
      the waves of a terrible necessity. What wonder that in the midst of these
      perplexities his courage should fail him! What wonder that the
      consciousness of fainting should increase the faintness! or that the dread
      of fear and its consequences should hasten and invigorate its attacks! To
      crown all, when he dropped into a troubled slumber at length, he found
      himself hurried, as on a storm of fire, through the streets of the
      captured town, from all the windows of which looked forth familiar faces,
      old and young, but distorted from the memory of his boyhood by fear and
      wild despair. On one spot lay the body of his father, with his face to the
      earth; and he woke at the cry of horror and rage that burst from his own
      lips, as he saw the rough, bloody hand of a soldier twisted in the loose
      hair of his elder sister, and the younger fainting in the arms of a
      scoundrel belonging to his own regiment. He slept no more. As the grey
      morning broke, the troops appointed for the attack assembled without sound
      of trumpet or drum, and were silently formed in fitting order. The young
      ensign was in his place, weary and wretched after his miserable night.
      Before him he saw a great, broad-shouldered lieutenant, whose brawny hand
      seemed almost too large for his sword-hilt, and in any one of whose limbs
      played more animal life than in the whole body of the pale youth. The
      firm-set lips of this officer, and the fire of his eye, showed a
      concentrated resolution, which, by the contrast, increased the misery of
      the ensign, and seemed, as if the stronger absorbed the weaker, to draw
      out from him the last fibres of self-possession: the sight of unattainable
      determination, while it increased the feeling of the arduousness of that
      which required such determination, threw him into the great gulf which lay
      between him and it. In this disorder of his nervous and mental condition,
      with a doubting conscience and a shrinking heart, is it any wonder that
      the terrors which lay before him at the gap in those bristling walls,
      should draw near, and, making sudden inroad upon his soul, overwhelm the
      government of a will worn out by the tortures of an unassured spirit? What
      share fear contributed to unman him, it was impossible for him, in the
      dark, confused conflict of differing emotions, to determine; but doubtless
      a natural shrinking from danger, there being no excitement to deaden its
      influence, and no hope of victory to encourage to the struggle, seeing
      victory was dreadful to him as defeat, had its part in the sad result.
      Many men who have courage, are dependent on ignorance and a low state of
      the moral feeling for that courage; and a further progress towards the
      development of the higher nature would, for a time at least, entirely
      overthrow it. Nor could such loss of courage be rightly designated by the
      name of cowardice. But, alas! the colonel happened to fix his eyes upon
      him as he passed along the file; and this completed his confusion. He
      betrayed such evident symptoms of perturbation, that that officer ordered
      him under arrest; and the result was, that, chiefly for the sake of
      example to the army, he was, upon trial by court-martial, expelled from
      the service, and had his sword broken over his head. Alas for the delicate
      minded youth! Alas for the home-darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after, he found at the bottom of his chest the pieces of the broken
      sword, and remembered that, at the time, he had lifted them from the
      ground and carried them away. But he could not recall under what impulse
      he had done so. Perhaps the agony he suffered, passing the bounds of
      mortal endurance, had opened for him a vista into the eternal, and had
      shown him, if not the injustice of the sentence passed upon him, yet his
      freedom from blame, or, endowing him with dim prophetic vision, had given
      him the assurance that some day the stain would be wiped from his soul,
      and leave him standing clear before the tribunal of his own honour. Some
      feeling like this, I say, may have caused him, with a passing gleam of
      indignant protest, to lift the fragments from the earth, and carry them
      away; even as the friends of a so-called traitor may bear away his
      mutilated body from the wheel. But if such was the case, the vision was
      soon overwhelmed and forgotten in the succeeding anguish. He could not see
      that, in mercy to his doubting spirit, the question which had agitated his
      mind almost to madness, and which no results of the impending conflict
      could have settled for him, was thus quietly set aside for the time; nor
      that, painful as was the dark, dreadful existence that he was now to pass
      in self-torment and moaning, it would go by, and leave his spirit clearer
      far, than if, in his apprehension, it had been stained with further
      blood-guiltiness, instead of the loss of honour. Years after, when he
      accidentally learned that on that very morning the whole of his company,
      with parts of several more, had, or ever they began to mount the breach,
      been blown to pieces by the explosion of a mine, he cried aloud in
      bitterness, &ldquo;Would God that my fear had not been discovered before I
      reached that spot!&rdquo; But surely it is better to pass into the next region
      of life having reaped some assurance, some firmness of character,
      determination of effort, and consciousness of the worth of life, in the
      present world; so approaching the future steadily and faithfully, and if
      in much darkness and ignorance, yet not in the oscillations of moral
      uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close upon the catastrophe followed a torpor, which lasted he did not know
      how long, and which wrapped in a thick fog all the succeeding events. For
      some time he can hardly be said to have had any conscious history. He
      awoke to life and torture when half-way across the sea towards his native
      country, where was no home any longer for him. To this point, and no
      farther, could his thoughts return in after years. But the misery which he
      then endured is hardly to be understood, save by those of like delicate
      temperament with himself. All day long he sat silent in his cabin; nor
      could any effort of the captain, or others on board, induce him to go on
      deck till night came on, when, under the starlight, he ventured into the
      open air. The sky soothed him then, he knew not how. For the face of
      nature is the face of God, and must bear expressions that can influence,
      though unconsciously to them, the most ignorant and hopeless of His
      children. Often did he watch the clouds in hope of a storm, his spirit
      rising and falling as the sky darkened or cleared; he longed, in the
      necessary selfishness of such suffering, for a tumult of waters to swallow
      the vessel; and only the recollection of how many lives were involved in
      its safety besides his own, prevented him from praying to God for
      lightning and tempest, borne on which he might dash into the haven of the
      other world. One night, following a sultry calm day, he thought that Mercy
      had heard his unuttered prayer. The air and sea were intense darkness,
      till a light as intense for one moment annihilated it, and the succeeding
      darkness seemed shattered with the sharp reports of the thunder that
      cracked without reverberation. He who had shrunk from battle with his
      fellow-men, rushed to the mainmast, threw himself on his knees, and
      stretched forth his arms in speechless energy of supplication; but the
      storm passed away overhead, and left him kneeling still by the uninjured
      mast. At length the vessel reached her port. He hurried on shore to bury
      himself in the most secret place he could find. <i>Out of sight</i> was
      his first, his only thought. Return to his mother he would not, he could
      not; and, indeed, his friends never learned his fate, until it had carried
      him far beyond their reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several weeks he lurked about like a malefactor, in low lodging-houses
      in narrow streets of the seaport to which the vessel had borne him,
      heeding no one, and but little shocked at the strange society and
      conversation with which, though only in bodily presence, he had to mingle.
      These formed the subjects of reflection in after times; and he came to the
      conclusion that, though much evil and much misery exist, sufficient to
      move prayers and tears in those who love their kind, yet there is less of
      both than those looking down from a more elevated social position upon the
      weltering heap of humanity, are ready to imagine; especially if they
      regard it likewise from the pedestal of self-congratulation on which a
      meagre type of religion has elevated them. But at length his little stock
      of money was nearly expended, and there was nothing that he could do, or
      learn to do, in this seaport. He felt impelled to seek manual labour,
      partly because he thought it more likely he could obtain that sort of
      employment, without a request for reference as to his character, which
      would lead to inquiry about his previous history; and partly, perhaps,
      from an instinctive feeling that hard bodily labour would tend to lessen
      his inward suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the town, therefore, at nightfall of a July day, carrying a little
      bundle of linen, and the remains of his money, somewhat augmented by the
      sale of various articles of clothing and convenience, which his change of
      life rendered superfluous and unsuitable. He directed his course
      northwards, travelling principally by night&mdash;so painfully did he
      shrink from the gaze even of foot-farers like himself; and sleeping during
      the day in some hidden nook of wood or thicket, or under the shadow of a
      great tree in a solitary field. So fine was the season, that for three
      successive weeks he was able to travel thus without inconvenience, lying
      down when the sun grew hot in the forenoon, and generally waking when the
      first faint stars were hesitating in the great darkening heavens that
      covered and shielded him. For above every cloud, above every storm, rise
      up, calm, clear, divine, the deep infinite skies; they embrace the tempest
      even as the sunshine; by their permission it exists within their boundless
      peace: therefore it cannot hurt, and must pass away, while there they
      stand as ever, domed up eternally, lasting, strong, and pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times he attempted to get agricultural employment; but the
      whiteness of his hands and the tone of his voice not merely suggested
      unfitness for labour, but generated suspicion as to the character of one
      who had evidently dropped from a rank so much higher, and was seeking
      admittance within the natural masonic boundaries and secrets and
      privileges of another. Disheartened somewhat, but hopeful, he journeyed
      on. I say hopeful; for the blessed power of life in the universe in fresh
      air and sunshine absorbed by active exercise, in winds, yea in rain,
      though it fell but seldom, had begun to work its natural healing, soothing
      effect, upon his perturbed spirit. And there was room for hope in his new
      endeavour. As his bodily strength increased, and his health, considerably
      impaired by inward suffering, improved, the trouble of his soul became
      more endurable&mdash;and in some measure to endure is to conquer and
      destroy. In proportion as the mind grows in the strength of patience, the
      disturber of its peace sickens and fades away. At length, one day, a widow
      lady in a village through which his road led him, gave him a day&rsquo;s work in
      her garden. He laboured hard and well, notwithstanding his soon-blistered
      hands, received his wages thankfully, and found a resting-place for the
      night on the low part of a haystack from which the upper portion had been
      cut away. Here he ate his supper of bread and cheese, pleased to have
      found such comfortable quarters, and soon fell fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke, the whole heavens and earth seemed to give a full denial to
      sin and sorrow. The sun was just mounting over the horizon, looking up the
      clear cloud-mottled sky. From millions of water-drops hanging on the
      bending stalks of grass, sparkled his rays in varied refraction,
      transformed here to a gorgeous burning ruby, there to an emerald, green as
      the grass, and yonder to a flashing, sunny topaz. The chanting priest-lark
      had gone up from the low earth, as soon as the heavenly light had begun to
      enwrap and illumine the folds of its tabernacle; and had entered the high
      heavens with his offering, whence, unseen, he now dropped on the earth the
      sprinkled sounds of his overflowing blessedness. The poor youth rose but
      to kneel, and cry, from a bursting heart, &ldquo;Hast Thou not, O Father, some
      care for me? Canst Thou not restore my lost honour? Can anything befall
      Thy children for which Thou hast no help? Surely, if the face of Thy world
      lie not, joy and not grief is at the heart of the universe. Is there none
      for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The highest poetic feeling of which we are now conscious, springs not from
      the beholding of perfected beauty, but from the mute sympathy which the
      creation with all its children manifests with us in the groaning and
      travailing which look for the sonship. Because of our need and aspiration,
      the snowdrop gives birth in our hearts to a loftier spiritual and poetic
      feeling, than the rose most complete in form, colour, and odour. The rose
      is of Paradise&mdash;the snowdrop is of the striving, hoping, longing
      Earth. Perhaps our highest poetry is the expression of our aspirations in
      the sympathetic forms of visible nature. Nor is this merely a longing for
      a restored Paradise; for even in the ordinary history of men, no man or
      woman that has fallen, can be restored to the position formerly held. Such
      must rise to a yet higher place, whence they can behold their former
      standing far beneath their feet. They must be restored by the attainment
      of something better than they ever possessed before, or not at all. If the
      law be a weariness, we must escape it by taking refuge with the spirit,
      for not otherwise can we fulfil the law than by being above the law. To
      escape the overhanging rocks of Sinai, we must climb to its secret top.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Is thy strait horizon dreary?
  Is thy foolish fancy chill?
  Change the feet that have grown weary
  For the wings that never will.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Thus, like one of the wandering knights searching the wide earth for the
      Sangreal, did he wander on, searching for his lost honour, or rather (for
      that he counted gone for ever) seeking unconsciously for the peace of mind
      which had departed from him, and taken with it, not the joy merely, but
      almost the possibility, of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, when his little store was all but exhausted, he was employed by a
      market gardener, in the neighbourhood of a large country town, to work in
      his garden, and sometimes take his vegetables to market. With him he
      continued for a few weeks, and wished for no change; until, one day
      driving his cart through the town, he saw approaching him an elderly
      gentleman, whom he knew at once, by his gait and carriage, to be a
      military man. Now he had never seen his uncle the retired officer, but it
      struck him that this might be he; and under the tyranny of his passion for
      concealment, he fancied that, if it were he, he might recognise him by
      some family likeness&mdash;not considering the improbability of his
      looking at him. This fancy, with the painful effect which the sight of an
      officer, even in plain clothes, had upon him, recalling the torture of
      that frightful day, so overcame him, that he found himself at the other
      end of an alley before he recollected that he had the horse and cart in
      charge. This increased his difficulty; for now he dared not return, lest
      his inquiries after the vehicle, if the horse had strayed from the direct
      line, should attract attention, and cause interrogations which he would be
      unable to answer. The fatal want of self-possession seemed again to ruin
      him. He forsook the town by the nearest way, struck across the country to
      another line of road, and before he was missed, was miles away, still in a
      northerly direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although he thus shunned the face of man, especially of any one who
      reminded him of the past, the loss of his reputation in their eyes was not
      the cause of his inward grief. That would have been comparatively
      powerless to disturb him, had he not lost his own respect. He quailed
      before his own thoughts; he was dishonoured in his own eyes. His
      perplexity had not yet sufficiently cleared away to allow him to see the
      extenuating circumstances of the case; not to say the fact that the
      peculiar mental condition in which he was at the time, removed the case
      quite out of the class of ordinary instances of cowardice. He condemned
      himself more severely than any of his judges would have dared; remembering
      that portion of his mental sensations which had savoured of fear, and
      forgetting the causes which had produced it. He judged himself a man
      stained with the foulest blot that could cleave to a soldier&rsquo;s name, a
      blot which nothing but death, not even death, could efface. But, inwardly
      condemned and outwardly degraded, his dread of recognition was intense;
      and feeling that he was in more danger of being discovered where the
      population was sparser, he resolved to hide himself once more in the midst
      of poverty; and, with this view, found his way to one of the largest of
      the manufacturing towns.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached it during the strike of a great part of the workmen; so that,
      though he found some difficulty in procuring employment, as might be
      expected from his ignorance of machine-labour, he yet was sooner
      successful than he would otherwise have been. Possessed of a natural
      aptitude for mechanical operations, he soon became a tolerable workman;
      and he found that his previous education assisted to the fitting execution
      of those operations even which were most purely mechanical.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found also, at first, that the unrelaxing attention requisite for the
      mastering of the many niceties of his work, of necessity drew his mind
      somewhat from its brooding over his misfortune, hitherto almost ceaseless.
      Every now and then, however, a pang would shoot suddenly to his heart, and
      turn his face pale, even before his consciousness had time to inquire what
      was the matter. So by degrees, as attention became less necessary, and the
      nervo-mechanical action of his system increased with use, his thoughts
      again returned to their old misery. He would wake at night in his poor
      room, with the feeling that a ghostly nightmare sat on his soul; that a
      want&mdash;a loss&mdash;miserable, fearful&mdash;was present; that
      something of his heart was gone from him; and through the darkness he
      would hear the snap of the breaking sword, and lie for a moment
      overwhelmed beneath the assurance of the incredible fact. Could it be true
      that <i>he</i> was a coward? that <i>his</i> honour was gone, and in its
      place a stain? that <i>he</i> was a thing for men&mdash;and worse, for
      women&mdash;to point the finger at, laughing bitter laughter? Never lover
      or husband could have mourned with the same desolation over the departure
      of the loved; the girl alone, weeping scorching tears over <i>her</i>
      degradation, could resemble him in his agony, as he lay on his bed, and
      wept and moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sufferings had returned with the greater weight, that he was no longer
      upheld by the &ldquo;divine air&rdquo; and the open heavens, whose sunlight now only
      reached him late in an afternoon, as he stood at his loom, through windows
      so coated with dust that they looked like frosted glass; showing, as it
      passed through the air to fall on the dirty floor, how the breath of life
      was thick with dust of iron and wood, and films of cotton; amidst which
      his senses were now too much dulled by custom to detect the exhalations
      from greasy wheels and overtasked human-kind. Nor could he find comfort in
      the society of his fellow-labourers. True, it was a kind of comfort to
      have those near him who could not know of his grief; but there was so
      little in common between them, that any interchange of thought was
      impossible. At least, so it seemed to him. Yet sometimes his longing for
      human companionship would drive him out of his dreary room at night, and
      send him wandering through the lower part of the town, where he would gaze
      wistfully on the miserable faces that passed him, as if looking for some
      one&mdash;some angel, even there&mdash;to speak goodwill to his hungry
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he entered one of those gin-palaces, which, like the golden gates of
      hell, entice the miserable to worse misery, and seated himself close to a
      half-tipsy, good-natured wretch, who made room for him on a bench by the
      wall. He was comforted even by this proximity to one who would not repel
      him. But soon the paintings of warlike action&mdash;of knights, and
      horses, and mighty deeds done with battle-axe, and broad-sword, which
      adorned the&mdash;panels all round, drove him forth even from this heaven
      of the damned; yet not before the impious thought had arisen in his heart,
      that the brilliantly painted and sculptural roof, with the gilded
      vine-leaves and bunches of grapes trained up the windows, all lighted with
      the great shining chandeliers, was only a microcosmic repetition of the
      bright heavens and the glowing earth, that overhung and surrounded the
      misery of man. But the memory of how kindly they had comforted and
      elevated him, at one period of his painful history, not only banished the
      wicked thought, but brought him more quiet, in the resurrection of a past
      blessing, than he had known for some time. The period, however, was now at
      hand when a new grief, followed by a new and more elevated activity, was
      to do its part towards the closing up of the fountain of bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst his fellow-labourers, he had for a short time taken some interest
      in observing a young woman, who had lately joined them. There was nothing
      remarkable about her, except what at first sight seemed a remarkable
      plainness. A slight scar over one of her rather prominent eyebrows,
      increased this impression of plainness. But the first day had not passed,
      before he began to see that there was something not altogether common in
      those deep eyes; and the plain look vanished before a closer observation,
      which also discovered, in the forehead and the lines of the mouth, traces
      of sorrow or other suffering. There was an expression, too, in the whole
      face, of fixedness of purpose, without any hardness of determination. Her
      countenance altogether seemed the index to an interesting mental history.
      Signs of mental trouble were always an attraction to him; in this case so
      great, that he overcame his shyness, and spoke to her one evening as they
      left the works. He often walked home with her after that; as, indeed, was
      natural, seeing that she occupied an attic in the same poor lodging-house
      in which he lived himself. The street did not bear the best character;
      nor, indeed, would the occupations of all the inmates of the house have
      stood investigation; but so retiring and quiet was this girl, and so
      seldom did she go abroad after work hours, that he had not discovered till
      then that she lived in the same street, not to say the same house with
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon learned her history&mdash;a very common one as outward events, but
      not surely insignificant because common. Her father and mother were both
      dead, and hence she had to find her livelihood alone, and amidst
      associations which were always disagreeable, and sometimes painful. Her
      quick womanly instinct must have discovered that he too had a history; for
      though, his mental prostration favouring the operation of outward
      influences, he had greatly approximated in appearance to those amongst
      whom he laboured, there were yet signs, besides the educated accent of his
      speech, which would have distinguished him to an observer; but she put no
      questions to him, nor made any approach towards seeking a return of the
      confidence she reposed in him. It was a sensible alleviation to his
      sufferings to hear her kind voice, and look in her gentle face, as they
      walked home together; and at length the expectation of this pleasure began
      to present itself, in the midst of the busy, dreary work-hours, as the
      shadow of a heaven to close up the dismal, uninteresting day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one morning he missed her from her place, and a keener pain passed
      through him than he had felt of late; for he knew that the Plague was
      abroad, feeding in the low stagnant places of human abode; and he had but
      too much reason to dread that she might be now struggling in its grasp. He
      seized the first opportunity of slipping out and hurrying home. He sprang
      upstairs to her room. He found the door locked, but heard a faint moaning
      within. To avoid disturbing her, while determined to gain an entrance, he
      went down for the key of his own door, with which he succeeded in
      unlocking hers, and so crossed her threshold for the first time. There she
      lay on her bed, tossing in pain, and beginning to be delirious. Careless
      of his own life, and feeling that he could not die better than in helping
      the only friend he had; certain, likewise, of the difficulty of finding a
      nurse for one in this disease and of her station in life; and sure,
      likewise, that there could be no question of propriety, either in the
      circumstances with which they were surrounded, nor in this case of
      terrible fever almost as hopeless for her as dangerous to him, he
      instantly began the duties of a nurse, and returned no more to his
      employment. He had a little money in his possession, for he could not, in
      the way in which he lived, spend all his wages; so he proceeded to make
      her as comfortable as he could, with all the pent-up tenderness of a
      loving heart finding an outlet at length. When a boy at home, he had often
      taken the place of nurse, and he felt quite capable of performing its
      duties. Nor was his boyhood far behind yet, although the trials he had
      come through made it appear an age since he had lost his light heart. So
      he never left her bedside, except to procure what was necessary for her.
      She was too ill to oppose any of his measures, or to seek to prohibit his
      presence. Indeed, by the time he had returned with the first medicine, she
      was insensible; and she continued so through the whole of the following
      week, during which time he was constantly with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That action produces feeling is as often true as its converse; and it is
      not surprising that, while he smoothed the pillow for her head, he should
      have made a nest in his heart for the helpless girl. Slowly and
      unconsciously he learned to love her. The chasm between his early
      associations and the circumstances in which he found her, vanished as he
      drew near to the simple, essential womanhood. His heart saw hers and loved
      it; and he knew that, the centre once gained, he could, as from the
      fountain of life, as from the innermost secret of the holy place, the
      hidden germ of power and possibility, transform the outer intellect and
      outermost manners as he pleased. With what a thrill of joy, a feeling for
      a long time unknown to him, and till now never known in this form or with
      this intensity, the thought arose in his heart that here lay one who some
      day would love him; that he should have a place of refuge and rest; one to
      lie in his bosom and not despise him! &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;I will
      call forth her soul from where it sleeps, like an unawakened echo, in an
      unknown cave; and like a child, of whom I once dreamed, that was mine, and
      to my delight turned in fear from all besides, and clung to me, this soul
      of hers will run with bewildered, half-sleeping eyes, and tottering steps,
      but with a cry of joy on its lips, to me as the life-giver. She will cling
      to me and worship me. Then will I tell her, for she must know all, that I
      am low and contemptible; that I am an outcast from the world, and that if
      she receive me, she will be to me as God. And I will fall down at her feet
      and pray her for comfort, for life, for restoration to myself; and she
      will throw herself beside me, and weep and love me, I know. And we will go
      through life together, working hard, but for each other; and when we die,
      she shall lead me into paradise as the prize her angel-hand found cast on
      a desert shore, from the storm of winds and waves which I was too weak to
      resist&mdash;and raised, and tended, and saved.&rdquo; Often did such thoughts
      as these pass through his mind while watching by her bed; alternated,
      checked, and sometimes destroyed, by the fears which attended her
      precarious condition, but returning with every apparent betterment or
      hopeful symptom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not stop to decide the nice question, how far the intention was
      right, of causing her to love him before she knew his story. If in the
      whole matter there was too much thought of self, my only apology is the
      sequel. One day, the ninth from the commencement of her illness, a letter
      arrived, addressed to her; which he, thinking he might prevent some
      inconvenience thereby, opened and read, in the confidence of that love
      which already made her and all belonging to her appear his own. It was
      from a soldier&mdash;<i>her lover</i>. It was plain that they had been
      betrothed before he left for the continent a year ago; but this was the
      first letter which he had written to her. It breathed changeless love, and
      hope, and confidence in her. He was so fascinated that he read it through
      without pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laying it down, he sat pale, motionless, almost inanimate. From the
      hard-won sunny heights, he was once more cast down into the shadow of
      death. The second storm of his life began, howling and raging, with yet
      more awful lulls between. &ldquo;Is she not <i>mine</i>?&rdquo; he said, in agony. &ldquo;Do
      I not feel that she is mine? Who will watch over her as I? Who will kiss
      her soul to life as I? Shall she be torn away from me, when my soul seems
      to have dwelt with hers for ever in an eternal house? But have I not a
      right to her? Have I not given my life for hers? Is he not a soldier, and
      are there not many chances that he may never return? And it may be that,
      although they were engaged in word, soul has never touched soul with them;
      their love has never reached that point where it passes from the mortal to
      the immortal, the indissoluble: and so, in a sense, she may be yet free.
      Will he do for her what I will do? Shall this precious heart of hers, in
      which I see the buds of so many beauties, be left to wither and die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here the voice within him cried out, &ldquo;Art thou the disposer of
      destinies? Wilt thou, in a universe where the visible God hath died for
      the Truth&rsquo;s sake, do evil that a good, which He might neglect or overlook,
      may be gained? Leave thou her to Him, and do thou right.&rdquo; And he said
      within himself, &ldquo;Now is the real trial for my life! Shall I conquer or
      no?&rdquo; And his heart awoke and cried, &ldquo;I will. God forgive me for wronging
      the poor soldier! A brave man, brave at least, is better for her than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great strength arose within him, and lifted him up to depart. &ldquo;Surely I
      may kiss her once,&rdquo; he said. For the crisis was over, and she slept. He
      stooped towards her face, but before he had reached her lips he saw her
      eyelids tremble; and he who had longed for the opening of those eyes, as
      of the gates of heaven, that she might love him, stricken now with fear
      lest she should love him, fled from her, before the eyelids that hid such
      strife and such victory from the unconscious maiden had time to unclose.
      But it was agony&mdash;quietly to pack up his bundle of linen in the room
      below, when he knew she was lying awake above, with her dear, pale face,
      and living eyes! What remained of his money, except a few shillings, he
      put up in a scrap of paper, and went out with his bundle in his hand,
      first to seek a nurse for his friend, and then to go he knew not whither.
      He met the factory people with whom he had worked, going to dinner, and
      amongst them a girl who had herself but lately recovered from the fever,
      and was yet hardly able for work. She was the only friend the sick girl
      had seemed to have amongst the women at the factory, and she was easily
      persuaded to go and take charge of her. He put the money in her hand,
      begging her to use it for the invalid, and promising to send the
      equivalent of her wages for the time he thought she would have to wait on
      her. This he easily did by the sale of a ring, which, besides his mother&rsquo;s
      watch, was the only article of value he had retained. He begged her
      likewise not to mention his name in the matter; and was foolish enough to
      expect that she would entirely keep the promise she had made him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wandering along the street, purposeless now and bereft, he spied a
      recruiting party at the door of a public-house; and on coming nearer,
      found, by one of those strange coincidences which do occur in life, and
      which have possibly their root in a hidden and wondrous law, that it was a
      party, perhaps a remnant, of the very regiment in which he had himself
      served, and in which his misfortune had befallen him. Almost
      simultaneously with the shock which the sight of the well-known number on
      the soldiers&rsquo; knapsacks gave him, arose in his mind the romantic, ideal
      thought, of enlisting in the ranks of this same regiment, and recovering,
      as a private soldier and unknown, that honour which as officer he had
      lost. To this determination, the new necessity in which he now stood for
      action and change of life, doubtless contributed, though unconsciously. He
      offered himself to the sergeant; and, notwithstanding that his dress
      indicated a mode of life unsuitable as the antecedent to a soldier&rsquo;s, his
      appearance, and the necessity for recruits combined, led to his easy
      acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English armies were employed in expelling the enemy from an invaded
      and helpless country. Whatever might be the political motives which had
      induced the Government to this measure, the young man was now able to feel
      that he could go and fight, individually and for his part, in the cause of
      liberty. He was free to possess his own motives for joining in the
      execution of the schemes of those who commanded his commanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a heavy heart, but with more of inward hope and strength than he had
      ever known before, he marched with his comrades to the seaport and
      embarked. It seemed to him that because he had done right in his last
      trial, here was a new glorious chance held out to his hand. True, it was a
      terrible change to pass from a woman in whom he had hoped to find healing,
      into the society of rough men, to march with them, &ldquo;<i>mitgleichem Tritt
      und Schritt</i>,&rdquo; up to the bristling bayonets or the horrid vacancy of
      the cannon mouth. But it was the only cure for the evil that consumed his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the army in safety, and gave himself, with religious assiduity,
      to the smallest duties of his new position. No one had a brighter polish
      on his arms, or whiter belts than he. In the necessary movements, he soon
      became precise to a degree that attracted the attention of his officers;
      while his character was remarkable for all the virtues belonging to a
      perfect soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as he stood sentry, he saw the eyes of his colonel intently fixed
      on him. He felt his lip quiver, but he compressed and stilled it, and
      tried to look as unconscious as he could; which effort was assisted by the
      formal bearing required by his position. Now the colonel, such had been
      the losses of the regiment, had been promoted from a lieutenancy in the
      same, and had belonged to it at the time of the ensign&rsquo;s degradation.
      Indeed, had not the changes in the regiment been so great, he could hardly
      have escaped so long without discovery. But the poor fellow would have
      felt that his name was already free of reproach, if he had seen what
      followed on the close inspection which had awakened his apprehensions, and
      which, in fact, had convinced the colonel of his identity with the
      disgraced ensign. With a hasty and less soldierly step than usual the
      colonel entered his tent, threw himself on his bed and wept like a child.
      When he rose he was overheard to say these words&mdash;and these only
      escaped his lips: &ldquo;He is nobler than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this officer showed himself worthy of commanding such men as this
      private; for right nobly did he understand and meet his feelings. He
      uttered no word of the discovery he had made, till years afterwards; but
      it soon began to be remarked that whenever anything arduous, or in any
      manner distinguished, had to be done, this man was sure to be of the party
      appointed. In short, as often as he could, the colonel &ldquo;set him in the
      forefront of the battle.&rdquo; Passing through all with wonderful escape, he
      was soon as much noticed for his reckless bravery, as hitherto for his
      precision in the discharge of duties bringing only commendation and not
      honour. But his final lustration was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great part of the army was hastening, by forced marches, to raise the
      siege of a town which was already on the point of falling into the hands
      of the enemy. Forming one of a reconnoitring party, which preceded the
      main body at some considerable distance, he and his companions came
      suddenly upon one of the enemy&rsquo;s outposts, occupying a high, and on one
      side precipitous rock, a short way from the town, which it commanded.
      Retreat was impossible, for they were already discovered, and the bullets
      were falling amongst them like the first of a hail-storm. The only
      possibility of escape remaining for them was a nearly hopeless
      improbability. It lay in forcing the post on this steep rock; which if
      they could do before assistance came to the enemy, they might, perhaps, be
      able to hold out, by means of its defences, till the arrival of the army.
      Their position was at once understood by all; and, by a sudden,
      simultaneous impulse, they found themselves halfway up the steep ascent,
      and in the struggle of a close conflict, without being aware of any order
      to that effect from their officer. But their courage was of no avail; the
      advantages of the place were too great; and in a few minutes the whole
      party was cut to pieces, or stretched helpless on the rock. Our youth had
      fallen amongst the foremost; for a musket ball had grazed his skull, and
      laid him insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But consciousness slowly returned, and he succeeded at last in raising
      himself and looking around him. The place was deserted. A few of his
      friends, alive, but grievously wounded, lay near him. The rest were dead.
      It appeared that, learning the proximity of the English forces from this
      rencontre with part of their advanced guard, and dreading lest the town,
      which was on the point of surrendering, should after all be snatched from
      their grasp, the commander of the enemy&rsquo;s forces had ordered an immediate
      and general assault; and had for this purpose recalled from their outposts
      the whole of his troops thus stationed, that he might make the attempt
      with the utmost strength he could accumulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the youth&rsquo;s power of vision returned, he perceived, from the height
      where he lay, that the town was already in the hands of the enemy. But
      looking down into the level space immediately below him, he started to his
      feet at once; for a girl, bare-headed, was fleeing towards the rock,
      pursued by several soldiers. &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said he, divining her purpose&mdash;the
      soldiers behind and the rock before her&mdash;&ldquo;I will help you to die!&rdquo;
       And he stooped and wrenched from the dead fingers of a sergeant the sword
      which they clenched by the bloody hilt. A new throb of life pulsed through
      him to his very finger-tips; and on the brink of the unseen world he
      stood, with the blood rushing through his veins in a wild dance of
      excitement. One who lay near him wounded, but recovered afterwards, said
      that he looked like one inspired. With a keen eye he watched the chase.
      The girl drew nigh; and rushed up the path near which he was standing.
      Close on her footsteps came the soldiers, the distance gradually lessening
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many paces higher up, was a narrower part of the ascent, where the
      path was confined by great stones, or pieces of rock. Here had been the
      chief defence in the preceding assault, and in it lay many bodies of his
      friends. Thither he went and took his stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the girl came, over the dead, with rigid hands and flying feet, the
      bloodless skin drawn tight on her features, and her eyes awfully large and
      wild. She did not see him though she bounded past so near that her hair
      flew in his eyes. &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we shall meet soon.&rdquo; And he
      stepped into the narrow path just in time to face her pursuers&mdash;between
      her and them. Like the red lightning the bloody sword fell, and a man
      beneath it. Cling! clang! went the echoes in the rocks&mdash;and another
      man was down; for, in his excitement, he was a destroying angel to the
      breathless pursuers. His stature rose, his chest dilated; and as the third
      foe fell dead, the girl was safe; for her body lay a broken, empty, but
      undesecrated temple, at the foot of the rock. That moment his sword flew
      in shivers from his grasp. The next instant he fell, pierced to the heart;
      and his spirit rose triumphant, free, strong, and calm, above the stormy
      world, which at length lay vanquished beneath him.

    <h2>
      THE GRAY WOLF
    </h2>
    <p>
      One evening-twilight in spring, a young English student, who had wandered
      northwards as far as the outlying fragments of Scotland called the Orkney
      and Shetland Islands, found himself on a small island of the latter group,
      caught in a storm of wind and hail, which had come on suddenly. It was in
      vain to look about for any shelter; for not only did the storm entirely
      obscure the landscape, but there was nothing around him save a desert
      moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, as he walked on for mere walking&rsquo;s sake, he found
      himself on the verge of a cliff, and saw, over the brow of it, a few feet
      below him, a ledge of rock, where he might find some shelter from the
      blast, which blew from behind. Letting himself down by his hands, he
      alighted upon something that crunched beneath his tread, and found the
      bones of many small animals scattered about in front of a little cave in
      the rock, offering the refuge he sought. He went in, and sat upon a stone.
      The storm increased in violence, and as the darkness grew he became
      uneasy, for he did not relish the thought of spending the night in the
      cave. He had parted from his companions on the opposite side of the
      island, and it added to his uneasiness that they must be full of
      apprehension about him. At last there came a lull in the storm, and the
      same instant he heard a footfall, stealthy and light as that of a wild
      beast, upon the bones at the mouth of the cave. He started up in some
      fear, though the least thought might have satisfied him that there could
      be no very dangerous animals upon the island. Before he had time to think,
      however, the face of a woman appeared in the opening. Eagerly the wanderer
      spoke. She started at the sound of his voice. He could not see her well,
      because she was turned towards the darkness of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me how to find my way across the moor to Shielness?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot find it to-night,&rdquo; she answered, in a sweet tone, and with a
      smile that bewitched him, revealing the whitest of teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother will give you shelter, but that is all she has to offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is far more than I expected a minute ago,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I shall
      be most grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned in silence and left the cave. The youth followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was barefooted, and her pretty brown feet went catlike over the sharp
      stones, as she led the way down a rocky path to the shore. Her garments
      were scanty and torn, and her hair blew tangled in the wind. She seemed
      about five and twenty, lithe and small. Her long fingers kept clutching
      and pulling nervously at her skirts as she went. Her face was very gray in
      complexion, and very worn, but delicately formed, and smooth-skinned. Her
      thin nostrils were tremulous as eyelids, and her lips, whose curves were
      faultless, had no colour to give sign of indwelling blood. What her eyes
      were like he could not see, for she had never lifted the delicate films of
      her eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the cliff, they came upon a little hut leaning against it,
      and having for its inner apartment a natural hollow within. Smoke was
      spreading over the face of the rock, and the grateful odour of food gave
      hope to the hungry student. His guide opened the door of the cottage; he
      followed her in, and saw a woman bending over a fire in the middle of the
      floor. On the fire lay a large fish broiling. The daughter spoke a few
      words, and the mother turned and welcomed the stranger. She had an old and
      very wrinkled, but honest face, and looked troubled. She dusted the only
      chair in the cottage, and placed it for him by the side of the fire,
      opposite the one window, whence he saw a little patch of yellow sand over
      which the spent waves spread themselves out listlessly. Under this window
      there was a bench, upon which the daughter threw herself in an unusual
      posture, resting her chin upon her hand. A moment after, the youth caught
      the first glimpse of her blue eyes. They were fixed upon him with a
      strange look of greed, amounting to craving, but, as if aware that they
      belied or betrayed her, she dropped them instantly. The moment she veiled
      them, her face, notwithstanding its colourless complexion, was almost
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the fish was ready, the old woman wiped the deal table, steadied it
      upon the uneven floor, and covered it with a piece of fine table-linen.
      She then laid the fish on a wooden platter, and invited the guest to help
      himself. Seeing no other provision, he pulled from his pocket a hunting
      knife, and divided a portion from the fish, offering it to the mother
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my lamb,&rdquo; said the old woman; and the daughter approached the
      table. But her nostrils and mouth quivered with disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment she turned and hurried from the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like fish,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t anything else
      to give her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not seem in good health,&rdquo; he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman answered only with a sigh, and they ate their fish with the help
      of a little rye bread. As they finished their supper, the youth heard the
      sound as of the pattering of a dog&rsquo;s feet upon the sand close to the door;
      but ere he had time to look out of the window, the door opened, and the
      young woman entered. She looked better, perhaps from having just washed
      her face. She drew a stool to the corner of the fire opposite him. But as
      she sat down, to his bewilderment, and even horror, the student spied a
      single drop of blood on her white skin within her torn dress. The woman
      brought out a jar of whisky, put a rusty old kettle on the fire, and took
      her place in front of it. As soon as the water boiled, she proceeded to
      make some toddy in a wooden bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the youth could not take his eyes off the young woman, so that at
      length he found himself fascinated, or rather bewitched. She kept her eyes
      for the most part veiled with the loveliest eyelids fringed with darkest
      lashes, and he gazed entranced; for the red glow of the little oil-lamp
      covered all the strangeness of her complexion. But as soon as he met a
      stolen glance out of those eyes unveiled, his soul shuddered within him.
      Lovely face and craving eyes alternated fascination and repulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother placed the bowl in his hands. He drank sparingly, and passed it
      to the girl. She lifted it to her lips, and as she tasted&mdash;only
      tasted it&mdash;looked at him. He thought the drink must have been drugged
      and have affected his brain. Her hair smoothed itself back, and drew her
      forehead backwards with it; while the lower part of her face projected
      towards the bowl, revealing, ere she sipped, her dazzling teeth in strange
      prominence. But the same moment the vision vanished; she returned the
      vessel to her mother, and rising, hurried out of the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the old woman pointed to a bed of heather in one corner with a
      murmured apology; and the student, wearied both with the fatigues of the
      day and the strangeness of the night, threw himself upon it, wrapped in
      his cloak. The moment he lay down, the storm began afresh, and the wind
      blew so keenly through the crannies of the hut, that it was only by
      drawing his cloak over his head that he could protect himself from its
      currents. Unable to sleep, he lay listening to the uproar which grew in
      violence, till the spray was dashing against the window. At length the
      door opened, and the young woman came in, made up the fire, drew the bench
      before it, and lay down in the same strange posture, with her chin propped
      on her hand and elbow, and her face turned towards the youth. He moved a
      little; she dropped her head, and lay on her face, with her arms crossed
      beneath her forehead. The mother had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drowsiness crept over him. A movement of the bench roused him, and he
      fancied he saw some four-footed creature as tall as a large dog trot
      quietly out of the door. He was sure he felt a rush of cold wind. Gazing
      fixedly through the darkness, he thought he saw the eyes of the damsel
      encountering his, but a glow from the falling together of the remnants of
      the fire revealed clearly enough that the bench was vacant. Wondering what
      could have made her go out in such a storm, he fell fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night he felt a pain in his shoulder, came broad
      awake, and saw the gleaming eyes and grinning teeth of some animal close
      to his face. Its claws were in his shoulder, and its mouth in the act of
      seeking his throat. Before it had fixed its fangs, however, he had its
      throat in one hand, and sought his knife with the other. A terrible
      struggle followed; but regardless of the tearing claws, he found and
      opened his knife. He had made one futile stab, and was drawing it for a
      surer, when, with a spring of the whole body, and one wildly contorted
      effort, the creature twisted its neck from his hold, and with something
      betwixt a scream and a howl, darted from him. Again he heard the door
      open; again the wind blew in upon him, and it continued blowing; a sheet
      of spray dashed across the floor, and over his face. He sprung from his
      couch and bounded to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wild night&mdash;dark, but for the flash of whiteness from the
      waves as they broke within a few yards of the cottage; the wind was
      raving, and the rain pouring down the air. A gruesome sound as of mingled
      weeping and howling came from somewhere in the dark. He turned again into
      the hut and closed the door, but could find no way of securing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was nearly out, and he could not be certain whether the form of
      the young woman was upon the bench or not. Overcoming a strong repugnance,
      he approached it, and put out his hands&mdash;there was nothing there. He
      sat down and waited for the daylight: he dared not sleep any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the day dawned at length, he went out yet again, and looked around.
      The morning was dim and gusty and gray. The wind had fallen, but the waves
      were tossing wildly. He wandered up and down the little strand, longing
      for more light.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he heard a movement in the cottage. By and by the voice of the
      old woman called to him from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re up early, sir. I doubt you didn&rsquo;t sleep well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very well,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But where is your daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not awake yet,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have but a poor
      breakfast for you. But you&rsquo;ll take a dram and a bit of fish. It&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve
      got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unwilling to hurt her, though hardly in good appetite, he sat down at the
      table. While they were eating, the daughter came in, but turned her face
      away and went to the farther end of the hut. When she came forward after a
      minute or two, the youth saw that her hair was drenched, and her face
      whiter than before. She looked ill and faint, and when she raised her
      eyes, all their fierceness had vanished, and sadness had taken its place.
      Her neck was now covered with a cotton handkerchief. She was modestly
      attentive to him, and no longer shunned his gaze. He was gradually
      yielding to the temptation of braving another night in the hut, and seeing
      what would follow, when the old woman spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The weather will be broken all day, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You had better be
      going, or your friends will leave without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ere he could answer, he saw such a beseeching glance on the face of the
      girl, that he hesitated, confused. Glancing at the mother, he saw the
      flash of wrath in her face. She rose and approached her daughter, with her
      hand lifted to strike her. The young woman stooped her head with a cry. He
      darted round the table to interpose between them. But the mother had
      caught hold of her; the handkerchief had fallen from her neck; and the
      youth saw five blue bruises on her lovely throat&mdash;the marks of the
      four fingers and the thumb of a left hand. With a cry of horror he darted
      from the house, but as he reached the door he turned. His hostess was
      lying motionless on the floor, and a huge gray wolf came bounding after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no weapon at hand; and if there had been, his inborn chivalry
      would never have allowed him to harm a woman even under the guise of a
      wolf. Instinctively, he set himself firm, leaning a little forward, with
      half outstretched arms, and hands curved ready to clutch again at the
      throat upon which he had left those pitiful marks. But the creature as she
      sprung eluded his grasp, and just as he expected to feel her fangs, he
      found a woman weeping on his bosom, with her arms around his neck. The
      next instant, the gray wolf broke from him, and bounded howling up the
      cliff. Recovering himself as he best might, the youth followed, for it was
      the only way to the moor above, across which he must now make his way to
      find his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he heard the sound of a crunching of bones&mdash;not as if a
      creature was eating them, but as if they were ground by the teeth of rage
      and disappointment; looking up, he saw close above him the mouth of the
      little cavern in which he had taken refuge the day before. Summoning all
      his resolution, he passed it slowly and softly. From within came the
      sounds of a mingled moaning and growling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached the top, he ran at full speed for some distance across the
      moor before venturing to look behind him. When at length he did so, he
      saw, against the sky, the girl standing on the edge of the cliff, wringing
      her hands. One solitary wail crossed the space between. She made no
      attempt to follow him, and he reached the opposite shore in safety.

    <h2>
      UNCLE CORNELIUS HIS STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a dull evening in November. A drizzling mist had been falling all
      day about the old farm. Harry Heywood and his two sisters sat in the
      house-place, expecting a visit from their uncle, Cornelius Heywood. This
      uncle lived alone, occupying the first floor above a chemist&rsquo;s shop in the
      town, and had just enough of money over to buy books that nobody seemed
      ever to have heard of but himself; for he was a student in all those
      regions of speculation in which anything to be called knowledge is
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a dreary night!&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;I wish uncle would come and tell us a
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cheerful wish,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Uncle Cornie is a lively companion&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      he? He cant even blunder through a Joe Miller without tacking a moral to
      it, and then trying to persuade you that the joke of it depends on the
      moral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he comes!&rdquo; said Kate, as three distinct blows with the knob of his
      walking-stick announced the arrival of Uncle Cornelius. She ran to the
      door to open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air had been very still all day, but as he entered he seemed to have
      brought the wind with him, for the first moan of it pressed against rather
      than shook the casement of the low-ceiled room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Cornelius was very tall, and very thin, and very pale, with large
      gray eyes that looked greatly larger because he wore spectacles of the
      most delicate hair-steel, with the largest pebble-eyes that ever were
      seen. He gave them a kindly greeting, but too much in earnest even in
      shaking hands to smile over it. He sat down in the arm-chair by the
      chimney corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been particular in my description of him, in order that my reader
      may give due weight to his words. I am such a believer in words, that I
      believe everything depends on who says them. Uncle Cornelius Heywood&rsquo;s
      story told word for word by Uncle Timothy Warren, would not have been the
      same story at all. Not one of the listeners would have believed a syllable
      of it from the lips of round-bodied, red-faced, small-eyed, little Uncle
      Tim; whereas from Uncle Cornie&mdash;disbelieve one of his stories if you
      could!
    </p>
    <p>
      One word more concerning him. His interest in everything conjectured or
      believed relative to the awful borderland of this world and the next, was
      only equalled by his disgust at the vulgar, unimaginative forms which
      curiosity about such subjects has assumed in the present day. With a
      yearning after the unseen like that of a child for the lifting of the
      curtain of a theatre, he declared that, rather than accept such a
      spirit-world as the would-be seers of the nineteenth century thought or
      pretended to reveal,&mdash;the prophets of a pauperised, workhouse
      immortality, invented by a poverty-stricken soul, and a sense so greedy
      that it would gorge on carrion,&mdash;he would rejoice to believe that a
      man had just as much of a soul as the cabbage of Iamblichus, namely, an
      aerial double of his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re come, uncle!&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t you come to
      dinner? We have been so gloomy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Katey, you know I don&rsquo;t admire eating. I never could bear to see a
      cow tearing up the grass with her long tongue.&rdquo; As he spoke he looked very
      much like a cow. He had a way of opening his jaws while he kept his lips
      closely pressed together, that made his cheeks fall in, and his face look
      awfully long and dismal. &ldquo;I consider eating,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;such an animal
      exercise that it ought always to be performed in private. You never saw me
      dine, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, uncle; but I have seen you drink;&mdash;nothing but water, I must
      confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes that is another affair. According to one eyewitness that is no more
      than the disembodied can do. I must confess, however, that, although well
      attested, the story is to me scarcely credible. Fancy a glass of Bavarian
      beer lifted into the air without a visible hand, turned upside down, and
      set empty on the table!&mdash;and no splash on the floor or anywhere
      else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A solitary gleam of humour shone through the great eyes of the spectacles
      as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, uncle! how can you believe such nonsense!&rdquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say I believed it&mdash;did I? But why not? The story has at
      least a touch of imagination in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a strange reason for believing a thing, uncle,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have a worse, Harry. I grant it is not sufficient; but it is
      better than that commonplace aspect which is the ground of most faith. I
      believe I did say that the story puzzled me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you give it any quarter at all, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does me no harm. There it is&mdash;between the boards of an old German
      book. There let it remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will never persuade me to believe such things,&rdquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I ask you, Janet,&rdquo; returned her uncle, gravely. &ldquo;I have not the
      slightest desire to convince you. How did we get into this unprofitable
      current of talk? We will change it at once. How are consols, Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, uncle!&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;we were longing for a story, and just as I
      thought you were coming to one, off you go to consols!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought a ghost story at least was coming,&rdquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did your best to stop it, Janet,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet began an angry retort, but Cornelius interrupted her. &ldquo;You never
      heard me tell a ghost story, Janet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have just told one about a drinking ghost, uncle,&rdquo; said Janet&mdash;in
      such a tone that Cornelius replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take that for your story, and let us talk of something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janet apparently saw that she had been rude, and said as sweetly as she
      might&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! but you didn&rsquo;t make that one, uncle. You got it out of a
      German book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it!&mdash;Make a ghost story!&rdquo; repeated Cornelius. &ldquo;No; that I never
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such things are not to be trifled with, are they?&rdquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I at least have no inclination to trifle with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, really and truly, uncle,&rdquo; persisted Janet, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t believe in
      such things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I either believe or disbelieve in them? They are not essential
      to salvation, I presume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must do the one or the other, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. You suppose wrong. It would take twice the proof I
      have ever had to make me believe in them; and exactly your prejudice, and
      allow me to say ignorance, to make me disbelieve in them. Neither is
      within my reach. I postpone judgment. But you, young people, of course,
      are wiser, and know all about the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, uncle! I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I did not mean to vex
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, not at all, my dear.&mdash;It wasn&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Kate went on, anxious to prevent anything unpleasant, for
      there was something very black perched on Janet&rsquo;s forehead, &ldquo;I have taken
      to reading about that kind of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you will give it up at once. You will bewilder your brains till you
      are ready to believe anything, if only it be absurd enough. Nay, you may
      come to find the element of vulgarity essential to belief. I should be
      sorry to the heart to believe concerning a horse or dog what they tell you
      nowadays about Shakespeare and Burns. What have you been reading, my
      girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, uncle. Only some Highland legends, which are too absurd
      either for my belief or for your theories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what could you do with such shapeless creatures as haunt their fords
      and pools for instance? They are as featureless as the faces of the
      mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so much the more terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that does not make it easier to believe in them,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only said,&rdquo; returned his uncle, &ldquo;that their shapelessness adds to their
      horror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you allowed&mdash;almost, at least, uncle,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;that you
      could find a place in your theories even for those shapeless creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius sat silent for a moment; then, having first doubled the length
      of his face, and restored it to its natural condition, said thoughtfully,
      &ldquo;I suspect, Katey, if you were to come upon an ichthyosaurus or a
      pterodactyl asleep in the shubbery, you would hardly expect your report of
      it to be believed all at once either by Harry or Janet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not, uncle. But I can&rsquo;t see what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course such a thing could not happen here and now. But there was a
      time when and a place where such a thing may have happened. Indeed, in my
      time, a traveller or two have got pretty soundly disbelieved for reporting
      what they saw,&mdash;the last of an expiring race, which had strayed over
      the natural verge of its history, coming to life in some neglected swamp,
      itself a remnant of the slime of Chaos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard you talk like that before, uncle,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;If you go
      on like that, you&rsquo;ll land me in a swamp, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talking to you at all, Harry. Kate challenged me to find a place
      for kelpies, and such like, in the theories she does me the honour of
      supposing I cultivate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think, uncle, that all these stories are only legends which, if
      you could follow them up, would lead you back to some one of the awful
      monsters that have since quite disappeared from the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible those stories may be such legends; but that was not what I
      intended to lead you to. I gave you that only as something like what I am
      going to say now. What if,&mdash;mind, I only suggest it,&mdash;what if
      the direful creatures, whose report lingers in these tales, should have an
      origin far older still? What if they were the remnants of a vanishing
      period of the earth&rsquo;s history long antecedent to the birth of mastodon and
      iguanodon; a stage, namely, when the world, as we call it, had not yet
      become quite visible, was not yet so far finished as to part from the
      invisible world that was its mother, and which, on its part, had not then
      become quite invisible&mdash;was only almost such; and when, as a credible
      consequence, strange shapes of those now invisible regions, Gorgons and
      Chimaeras dire, might be expected to gloom out occasionally from the awful
      Fauna of an ever-generating world upon that one which was being born of
      it. Hence, the life-periods of a world being long and slow, some of these
      huge, unformed bulks of half-created matter might, somehow, like the
      megatherium of later times,&mdash;a baby creation to them,&mdash;roll at
      age-long intervals, clothed in a mighty terror of shapelessness into the
      half-recognition of human beings, whose consternation at the uncertain
      vision were barrier enough to prevent all further knowledge of its
      substance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to have some notion of your meaning, uncle,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said Janet, &ldquo;all that must be over by this time. That world
      has been invisible now for many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since you were born, I suppose, Janet. The changes of a world are
      not to be measured by the changes of its generations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but, uncle, there can&rsquo;t be any such things. You know that as well as
      I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just as well, and no better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be any ghosts now. Nobody believes such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as to ghosts, that is quite another thing. I did not know you were
      talking with reference to them. It is no wonder if one can get nothing
      sensible out of you, Janet, when your discrimination is no greater than to
      lump everything marvellous, kelpies, ghosts, vampires, doubles, witches,
      fairies, nightmares, and I don&rsquo;t know what all, under the one head of
      ghosts; and we haven&rsquo;t been saying a word about them. If one were to
      disprove to you the existence of the afreets of Eastern tales, you would
      consider the whole argument concerning the reappearance of the departed
      upset. I congratulate you on your powers of analysis and induction, Miss
      Janet. But it matters very little whether we believe in ghosts, as you
      say, or not, provided we believe that we are ghosts&mdash;that within this
      body, which so many people are ready to consider their own very selves,
      their lies a ghostly embryo, at least, which has an inner side to it God
      only can see, which says I concerning itself, and which will soon have to
      know whether or not it can appear to those whom it has left behind, and
      thus solve the question of ghosts for itself, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do believe in ghosts, uncle?&rdquo; said Janet, in a tone that
      certainly was not respectful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I said nothing of the sort, Janet. The man most convinced that he
      had himself had such an interview as you hint at, would find&mdash;ought
      to find it impossible to convince any one else of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite out of my depth, uncle,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Surely any honest man
      ought to be believed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honesty is not all, by any means, that is necessary to being believed. It
      is impossible to convey a conviction of anything. All you can do is to
      convey a conviction that you are convinced. Of course, what satisfied you
      might satisfy another; but, till you can present him with the sources of
      your conviction, you cannot present him with the conviction&mdash;and
      perhaps not even then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell him all about, it, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is telling a man about a ghost, affording him the source of your
      conviction? Is it the same as a ghost appearing to him? Really, Harry!&mdash;You
      cannot even convey the impression a dream has made upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t that just because it is only a dream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. The impression may be deeper and clearer on your mind than
      any fact of the next morning will make. You will forget the next day
      altogether, but the impression of the dream will remain through all the
      following whirl and storm of what you call facts. Now a conviction may be
      likened to a deep impression on the judgment or the reason, or both. No
      one can feel it but the person who is convinced. It cannot be conveyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy that is just what those who believe in spirit-rapping would say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the true and false of convictions, as of everything else. I
      mean that a man may take that for a conviction in his own mind which is
      not a conviction, but only resembles one. But those to whom you refer
      profess to appeal to facts. It is on the ground of those facts, and with
      the more earnestness the more reason they can give for receiving them as
      facts, that I refuse all their deductions with abhorrence. I mean that, if
      what they say is true, the thinker must reject with contempt the claim to
      anything like revelation therein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do not believe in ghosts, after all?&rdquo; said Kate, in a tone of
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say so, my dear. Will you be reasonable, or will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear uncle, do tell us what you really think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been telling you what I think ever since I came, Katey; and you
      won&rsquo;t take in a word I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been taking in every word, uncle, and trying hard to understand it
      as well.&mdash;Did you ever see a ghost, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius Heywood was silent. He shut his lips and opened his jaws till
      his cheeks almost met in the vacuum. A strange expression crossed the
      strange countenance, and the great eyes of his spectacles looked as if, at
      the very moment, they were seeing something no other spectacles could see.
      Then his jaws closed with a snap, his countenance brightened, a flash of
      humour came through the goggle eyes of pebble, and, at length, he actually
      smiled as he said&mdash;&ldquo;Really, Katey, you must take me for a simpleton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think, if I had ever seen a ghost, I would confess the fact before a
      set of creatures like you&mdash;all spinning your webs like so many
      spiders to catch and devour old Daddy Longlegs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Harry had grown quite grave. &ldquo;Indeed, I am very sorry,
      uncle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I have deserved such a rebuke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my boy,&rdquo; said Cornelius; &ldquo;I did not mean it more than half. If I
      had meant it, I would not have said it. If you really would like&mdash;&rdquo;
       Here he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed we should, uncle,&rdquo; said Kate, earnestly. &ldquo;You should have heard
      what we were saying just before you came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you were saying, Katey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Kate, thoughtfully. &ldquo;The worst we said was that you could
      not tell a story without&mdash;well, we did say tacking a moral to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! I mustn&rsquo;t push it. A man has no right to know what people say
      about him. It unfits him for occupying his real position amongst them. He,
      least of all, has anything to do with it. If his friends won&rsquo;t defend him,
      he can&rsquo;t defend himself. Besides, what people say is so often untrue!&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t mean to others, but to themselves. Their hearts are more honest than
      their mouths. But Janet doesn&rsquo;t want a strange story, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janet certainly was not one to have chosen for a listener to such a tale.
      Her eyes were so small that no satisfaction could possibly come of it.
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t mind, uncle,&rdquo; she said, with half-affected indifference, as
      she searched in her box for silk to mend her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not very encouraging, I must say,&rdquo; returned her uncle, making
      another cow-face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go away, if you like,&rdquo; said Janet, pretending to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never mind,&rdquo; said her uncle hastily. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want me to tell
      it, I want you to hear it; and, before I have done, that may have come to
      the same thing perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you really are going to tell us a ghost story!&rdquo; said Kate, drawing
      her chair nearer to her uncle&rsquo;s; and then, finding this did not satisfy
      her sense of propinquity to the source of the expected pleasure, drawing a
      stool from the corner, and seating herself almost on the hearth-rug at his
      knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say so,&rdquo; returned Cornelius, once more. &ldquo;I said I would tell
      you a strange story. You may call it a ghost story if you like; I do not
      pretend to determine what it is. I confess it will look like one, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After so many delays, Uncle Cornelius now plunged almost hurriedly into
      his narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the year 1820,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the month of August, I fell in love.&rdquo;
       Here the girls glanced at each other. The idea of Uncle Cornie in love,
      and in the very same century in which they were now listening to the
      confession, was too astonishing to pass without ocular remark; but, if he
      observed it, he took no notice of it; he did not even pause. &ldquo;In the month
      of September, I was refused. Consequently, in the month of October, I was
      ready to fall in love again. Take particular care of yourself, Harry, for
      a whole month, at least, after your first disappointment; for you will
      never be more likely to do a foolish thing. Please yourself after the
      second. If you are silly then, you may take what you get, for you will
      deserve it&mdash;except it be good fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you do a foolish thing then, uncle?&rdquo; asked Harry, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, as you will see; for I fell in love again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything so very foolish in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have repented it since, though. Don&rsquo;t interrupt me again, please. In
      the middle of October, then, in the year 1820, in the evening, I was
      walking across Russell Square, on my way home from the British Museum,
      where I had been reading all day. You see I have a full intention of being
      precise, Janet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why you make the remark to me, uncle,&rdquo; said Janet,
      with an involuntary toss of her head. Her uncle only went on with his
      narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin at the very beginning of my story,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for I want to be
      particular as to everything that can appear to have had anything to do
      with what came afterwards. I had been reading, I say, all the morning in
      the British Museum; and, as I walked, I took off my spectacles to ease my
      eyes. I need not tell you that I am short-sighted now, for that you know
      well enough. But I must tell you that I was short-sighted then, and
      helpless enough without my spectacles, although I was not quite so much so
      as I am now;&mdash;for I find it all nonsense about short-sighted eyes
      improving with age. Well, I was walking along the south side of Russell
      Square, with my spectacles in my hand, and feeling a little bewildered in
      consequence&mdash;for it was quite the dusk of the evening, and
      short-sighted people require more light than others. I was feeling, in
      fact, almost blind. I had got more than half-way to the other side, when,
      from the crossing that cuts off the corner in the direction of Montagu
      Place, just as I was about to turn towards it, an old lady stepped upon
      the kerbstone of the pavement, looked at me for a moment, and passed&mdash;an
      occurrence not very remarkable, certainly. But the lady was remarkable,
      and so was her dress. I am not good at observing, and I am still worse at
      describing dress, therefore I can only say that hers reminded me of an old
      picture&mdash;that is, I had never seen anything like it, except in old
      pictures. She had no bonnet, and looked as if she had walked straight out
      of an ancient drawing-room in her evening attire. Of her face I shall say
      nothing now. The next instant I met a man on the crossing, who stopped and
      addressed me. So short-sighted was I that, although I recognised his voice
      as one I ought to know, I could not identify him until I had put on my
      spectacles, which I did instinctively in the act of returning his
      greeting. At the same moment I glanced over my shoulder after the old
      lady. She was nowhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What are you looking at?&rsquo; asked James Hetheridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I was looking after that old lady,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t see her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What old lady?&rsquo; said Hetheridge, with just a touch of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You must have seen her,&rsquo; I returned. &lsquo;You were not more than three yards
      behind her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where is she then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She must have gone down one of the areas, I think. But she looked a
      lady, though an old-fashioned one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Have you been dining?&rsquo; asked James, in a tone of doubtful inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I replied, not suspecting the insinuation; &lsquo;I have only just come
      from the Museum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then I advise you to call on your medical man before you go home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Medical man!&rsquo; I returned; &lsquo;I have no medical man. What do you mean? I
      never was better in my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I mean that there was no old lady. It was an illusion, and that
      indicates something wrong. Besides, you did not know me when I spoke to
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is nothing,&rdquo; I returned. &lsquo;I had just taken off my spectacles, and
      without them I shouldn&rsquo;t know my own father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How was it you saw the old lady, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The affair was growing serious under my friend&rsquo;s cross-questioning. I did
      not at all like the idea of his supposing me subject to hallucinations. So
      I answered, with a laugh, &lsquo;Ah! to be sure, that explains it. I am so blind
      without my spectacles, that I shouldn&rsquo;t know an old lady from a big dog.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There was no big dog,&rsquo; said Hetheridge, shaking his head, as the fact
      for the first time dawned upon me that, although I had seen the old lady
      clearly enough to make a sketch of her, even to the features of her
      care-worn, eager old face, I had not been able to recognise the well-known
      countenance of James Hetheridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what comes of reading till the optic nerve is weakened,&rdquo; he went
      on. &lsquo;You will cause yourself serious injury if you do not pull up in time.
      I&rsquo;ll tell you what; I&rsquo;m going home next week&mdash;will you go with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are very kind,&rsquo; I answered, not altogether rejecting the proposal,
      for I felt that a little change to the country would be pleasant, and I
      was quite my own master. For I had unfortunately means equal to my wants,
      and had no occasion to follow any profession&mdash;not a very desirable
      thing for a young man, I can tell you, Master Harry. I need not keep you
      over the commonplaces of pressing and yielding. It is enough to say that
      he pressed and that I yielded. The day was fixed for our departure
      together; but something or other, I forget what, occurred, to make him
      advance the date, and it was resolved that I should follow later in the
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a drizzly afternoon in the beginning of the last week of October
      when I left the town of Bradford in a post-chaise to drive to Lewton
      Grange, the property of my friend&rsquo;s father. I had hardly left the town,
      and the twilight had only begun to deepen, when, glancing from one of the
      windows of the chaise, I fancied I saw, between me and the hedge, the dim
      figure of a horse keeping pace with us. I thought, in the first interval
      of unreason, that it was a shadow from my own horse, but reminded myself
      the next moment that there could be no shadow where there was no light.
      When I looked again, I was at the first glance convinced that my eyes had
      deceived me. At the second, I believed once more that a shadowy something,
      with the movements of a horse in harness, was keeping pace with us. I
      turned away again with some discomfort, and not till we had reached an
      open moorland road, whence a little watery light was visible on the
      horizon, could I summon up courage enough to look out once more. Certainly
      then there was nothing to be seen, and I persuaded myself that it had been
      all a fancy, and lighted a cigar. With my feet on the cushions before me,
      I had soon lifted myself on the clouds of tobacco far above all the
      terrors of the night, and believed them banished for ever. But, my cigar
      coming to an end just as we turned into the avenue that led up to the
      Grange, I found myself once more glancing nervously out of the window. The
      moment the trees were about me, there was, if not a shadowy horse out
      there by the side of the chaise, yet certainly more than half that
      conviction in here in my consciousness. When I saw my friend, however,
      standing on the doorstep, dark against the glow of the hall fire, I forgot
      all about it; and I need not add that I did not make it a subject of
      conversation when I entered, for I was well aware that it was essential to
      a man&rsquo;s reputation that his senses should be accurate, though his heart
      might without prejudice swarm with shadows, and his judgment be a very
      stable of hobbies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was kindly received. Mrs. Hetheridge had been dead for some years, and
      Laetitia, the eldest of the family, was at the head of the household. She
      had two sisters, little more than girls. The father was a burly, yet
      gentlemanlike Yorkshire squire, who ate well, drank well, looked radiant,
      and hunted twice a week. In this pastime his son joined him when in the
      humour, which happened scarcely so often. I, who had never crossed a horse
      in my life, took his apology for not being able to mount me very coolly,
      assuring him that I would rather loiter about with a book than be in at
      the death of the best-hunted fox in Yorkshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I very soon found myself at home with the Hetheridges; and very soon
      again I began to find myself not so much at home; for Miss Hetheridge&mdash;Laetitia
      as I soon ventured to call her&mdash;was fascinating. I have told you,
      Katey, that there was an empty place in my heart. Look to the door then,
      Katey. That was what made me so ready to fall in love with Laetitia. Her
      figure was graceful, and I think, even now, her face would have been
      beautiful but for a certain contraction of the skin over the nostrils,
      suggesting an invisible thumb and forefinger pinching them, which repelled
      me, although I did not then know what it indicated. I had not been with
      her one evening before the impression it made on me had vanished, and that
      so entirely that I could hardly recall the perception of the peculiarity
      which had occasioned it. Her observation was remarkably keen, and her
      judgment generally correct. She had great confidence in it herself; nor
      was she devoid of sympathy with some of the forms of human imagination,
      only they never seemed to possess for her any relation to practical life.
      That was to be ordered by the judgment alone. I do not mean she ever said
      so. I am only giving the conclusions I came to afterwards. It is not
      necessary that you should have any more thorough acquaintance with her
      mental character. One point in her moral nature, of special consequence to
      my narrative, will show itself by and by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did all I could to make myself agreeable to her, and the more I
      succeeded the more delightful she became in my eyes. We walked in the
      garden and grounds together; we read, or rather I read and she listened;&mdash;read
      poetry, Katey&mdash;sometimes till we could not read any more for certain
      haziness and huskiness which look now, I am afraid, considerably more
      absurd than they really were, or even ought to look. In short, I
      considered myself thoroughly in love with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wasn&rsquo;t she in love with you, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me, child. I don&rsquo;t know. I hoped so then. I hope the
      contrary now. She liked me I am sure. That is not much to say. Liking is
      very pleasant and very cheap. Love is as rare as a star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the stars were anything but rare, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you never went out to find one for yourself, Katey. They
      would prove a few miles apart then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would be big enough when I did find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, my dear. That is the way with love.&mdash;Laetitia was a good
      housekeeper. Everything was punctual as clockwork. I use the word
      advisedly. If her father, who was punctual to one date,&mdash;the
      dinner-hour,&mdash;made any remark to the contrary as he took up the
      carving-knife, Laetitia would instantly send one of her sisters to
      question the old clock in the hall, and report the time to half a minute.
      It was sure to be found that, if there was a mistake, the mistake was in
      the clock. But although it was certainly a virtue to have her household in
      such perfect order, it was not a virtue to be impatient with every
      infringement of its rules on the part of others. She was very severe, for
      instance, upon her two younger sisters if, the moment after the second
      bell had rung, they were not seated at the dinner-table, washed and
      aproned. Order was a very idol with her. Hence the house was too tidy for
      any sense of comfort. If you left an open book on the table, you would, on
      returning to the room a moment after, find it put aside. What the
      furniture of the drawing-room was like, I never saw; for not even on
      Christmas Day, which was the last day I spent there, was it uncovered.
      Everything in it was kept in bibs and pinafores. Even the carpet was
      covered with a cold and slippery sheet of brown holland. Mr. Hetheridge
      never entered that room, and therein was wise. James remonstrated once.
      She answered him quite kindly, even playfully, but no change followed.
      What was worse, she made very wretched tea. Her father never took tea;
      neither did James. I was rather fond of it, but I soon gave it up.
      Everything her father partook of was first-rate. Everything else was
      somewhat poverty-stricken. My pleasure in Laetitia&rsquo;s society prevented me
      from making practical deductions from such trifles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought you knew anything about eating, uncle,&rdquo; said
      Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The less a man eats, the more he likes to have it good, Janet. In short,&mdash;there
      can be no harm in saying it now,&mdash;Laetitia was so far from being like
      the name of her baptism,&mdash;and most names are so good that they are
      worth thinking about; no children are named after bad ideas,&mdash;Laetitia
      was so far unlike hers as to be stingy&mdash;an abominable fault. But, I
      repeat, the notion of such a fact was far from me then. And now for my
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first of November was a very lovely day, quite one of the &lsquo;halcyon
      days&rsquo; of &lsquo;St. Martin&rsquo;s summer.&rsquo; I was sitting in a little arbour I had
      just discovered, with a book in my hand,&mdash;not reading, however, but
      day-dreaming,&mdash;when, lifting my eyes from the ground, I was startled
      to see, through a thin shrub in front of the arbour, what seemed the form
      of an old lady seated, apparently reading from a book on her knee. The
      sight instantly recalled the old lady of Russell Square. I started to my
      feet, and then, clear of the intervening bush, saw only a great stone such
      as abounded on the moors in the neighbourhood, with a lump of quartz set
      on the top of it. Some childish taste had put it there for an ornament.
      Smiling at my own folly, I sat down again, and reopened my book. After
      reading for a while, I glanced up again, and once more started to my feet,
      overcome by the fancy that there verily sat the old lady reading. You will
      say it indicated an excited condition of the brain. Possibly; but I was,
      as far as I can recall, quite collected and reasonable. I was almost vexed
      this second time, and sat down once more to my book. Still, every time I
      looked up, I was startled afresh. I doubt, however, if the trifle is worth
      mentioning, or has any significance even in relation to what followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After dinner I strolled out by myself, leaving father and son over their
      claret. I did not drink wine; and from the lawn I could see the windows of
      the library, whither Laetitia commonly retired from the dinner-table. It
      was a very lovely soft night. There was no moon, but the stars looked
      wider awake than usual. Dew was falling, but the grass was not yet wet,
      and I wandered about on it for half an hour. The stillness was somehow
      strange. It had a wonderful feeling in it as if something were expected&mdash;as
      if the quietness were the mould in which some event or other was about to
      be cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even then I was a reader of certain sorts of recondite lore. Suddenly I
      remembered that this was the eve of All Souls. This was the night on which
      the dead came out of their graves to visit their old homes. &lsquo;Poor dead!&rsquo; I
      thought with myself; &lsquo;have you any place to call a home now? If you have,
      surely you will not wander back here, where all that you called home has
      either vanished or given itself to others, to be their home now and yours
      no more! What an awful doom the old fancy has allotted you! To dwell in
      your graves all the year, and creep out, this one night, to enter at the
      midnight door, left open for welcome! A poor welcome truly!&mdash;just an
      open door, a clean-swept floor, and a fire to warm your rain-sodden limbs!
      The household asleep, and the house-place swarming with the ghosts of
      ancient times,&mdash;the miser, the spendthrift, the profligate, the
      coquette,&mdash;for the good ghosts sleep, and are troubled with no waking
      like yours! Not one man, sleepless like yourselves, to question you, and
      be answered after the fashion of the old nursery rhyme&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;What makes your eyes so holed?&rsquo; 
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lain so long among the mould.&rsquo; 
  &lsquo;What makes your feet so broad?&rsquo; 
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve walked more than ever I rode!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yet who can tell?&rsquo; I went on to myself. &lsquo;It may be your hell to return
      thus. It may be that only on this one night of all the year you can show
      yourselves to him who can see you, but that the place where you were
      wicked is the Hades to which you are doomed for ages.&rsquo; I thought and
      thought till I began to feel the air alive about me, and was enveloped in
      the vapours that dim the eyes of those who strain them for one peep
      through the dull mica windows that will not open on the world of ghosts.
      At length I cast my fancies away, and fled from them to the library, where
      the bodily presence of Laetitia made the world of ghosts appear shadowy
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What a reality there is about a bodily presence!&rsquo; I said to myself, as I
      took my chamber-candle in my hand. &lsquo;But what is there more real in a
      body?&rsquo; I said again, as I crossed the hall. &lsquo;Surely nothing,&rsquo; I went on,
      as I ascended the broad staircase to my room. &lsquo;The body must vanish. If
      there be a spirit, that will remain. A body can but vanish. A ghost can
      appear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I woke in the morning with a sense of such discomfort as made me spring
      out of bed at once. My foot lighted upon my spectacles. How they came to
      be on the floor I could not tell, for I never took them off when I went to
      bed. When I lifted them I found they were in two pieces; the bridge was
      broken. This was awkward. I was so utterly helpless without them! Indeed,
      before I could lay my hand on my hair-brush I had to peer through one eye
      of the parted pair. When I looked at my watch after I was dressed, I found
      I had risen an hour earlier than usual. I groped my way downstairs to
      spend the hour before breakfast in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sooner was I seated with a book than I heard the voice of Laetitia
      scolding the butler, in no very gentle tones, for leaving the garden door
      open all night. The moment I heard this, the strange occurrences I am
      about to relate began to dawn upon my memory. The door had been open the
      night long between All Saints and All Souls. In the middle of that night I
      awoke suddenly. I knew it was not the morning by the sensations I had, for
      the night feels altogether different from the morning. It was quite dark.
      My heart was beating violently, and I either hardly could or hardly dared
      breathe. A nameless terror was upon me, and my sense of hearing was,
      apparently by the force of its expectation, unnaturally roused and keen.
      There it was&mdash;a slight noise in the room!&mdash;slight, but clear,
      and with an unknown significance about it! It was awful to think it would
      come again. I do believe it was only one of those creaks in the timbers
      which announce the torpid, age-long, sinking flow of every house back to
      the dust&mdash;a motion to which the flow of the glacier is as a torrent,
      but which is no less inevitable and sure. Day and night it ceases not; but
      only in the night, when house and heart are still, do we hear it. No
      wonder it should sound fearful! for are we not the immortal dwellers in
      ever-crumbling clay? The clay is so near us, and yet not of us, that its
      every movement starts a fresh dismay. For what will its final ruin
      disclose? When it falls from about us, where shall we find that we have
      existed all the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My skin tingled with the bursting of the moisture from its pores.
      Something was in the room beside me. A confused, indescribable sense of
      utter loneliness, and yet awful presence, was upon me, mingled with a
      dreary, hopeless desolation, as of burnt-out love and aimless life. All at
      once I found myself sitting up. The terror that a cold hand might be laid
      upon me, or a cold breath blow on me, or a corpse-like face bend down
      through the darkness over me, had broken my bonds!&mdash;I would meet
      half-way whatever might be approaching. The moment that my will burst into
      action the terror began to ebb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room in which I slept was a large one, perfectly dreary with
      tidiness. I did not know till afterwards that it was Laetitia&rsquo;s room,
      which she had given up to me rather than prepare another. The furniture,
      all but one article, was modern and commonplace. I could not help
      remarking to myself afterwards how utterly void the room was of the
      nameless charm of feminine occupancy. I had seen nothing to wake a
      suspicion of its being a lady&rsquo;s room. The article I have excepted was an
      ancient bureau, elaborate and ornate, which stood on one side of the large
      bow window. The very morning before, I had seen a bunch of keys hanging
      from the upper part of it, and had peeped in. Finding however, that the
      pigeon-holes were full of papers, I closed it at once. I should have been
      glad to use it, but clearly it was not for me. At that bureau the figure
      of a woman was now seated in the posture of one writing. A strange dim
      light was around her, but whence it proceeded I never thought of
      inquiring. As if I, too, had stepped over the bourne, and was a ghost
      myself, all fear was now gone. I got out of bed, and softly crossed the
      room to where she was seated. &lsquo;If she should be beautiful!&rsquo; I thought&mdash;for
      I had often dreamed of a beautiful ghost that made love to me. The figure
      did not move. She was looking at a faded brown paper. &lsquo;Some old
      love-letter,&rsquo; I thought, and stepped nearer. So cool was I now, that I
      actually peeped over her shoulder. With mingled surprise and dismay I
      found that the dim page over which she bent was that of an old
      account-book. Ancient household records, in rusty ink, held up to the
      glimpses of the waning moon, which shone through the parting in the
      curtains, their entries of shillings and pence!&mdash;Of pounds there was
      not one. No doubt pounds and farthings are much the same in the world of
      thought&mdash;the true spirit-world; but in the ghost-world this eagerness
      over shillings and pence must mean something awful! I To think that coins
      which had since been worn smooth in other pockets and purses, which had
      gone back to the Mint, and been melted down, to come out again and yet
      again with the heads of new kings and queens,&mdash;that dinners, eaten by
      men and women and children whose bodies had since been eaten by the worms,&mdash;that
      polish for the floors, inches of whose thickness had since been worn away,&mdash;that
      the hundred nameless trifles of a life utterly vanished, should be
      perplexing, annoying, and worst of all, interesting the soul of a ghost
      who had been in Hades for centuries! The writing was very old-fashioned,
      and the words were contracted. I could read nothing but the moneys and one
      single entry&mdash;&lsquo;Corinths, Vs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Currants for a Christmas pudding, most likely!&mdash;Ah, poor lady! the
      pudding and not the Christmas was her care; not the delight of the
      children over it, but the beggarly pence which it cost. And she cannot get
      it out of her head, although her brain was &lsquo;powdered all as thin as flour&rsquo; 
      ages ago in the mortar of Death. &lsquo;Alas, poor ghost!&rsquo; It needs no treasured
      hoard left behind, no floor stained with the blood of the murdered child,
      no wickedly hidden parchment of landed rights! An old account-book is
      enough for the hell of the housekeeping gentlewoman!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never lifted her face, or seemed to know that I stood behind her. I
      left her, and went into the bow window, where I could see her face. I was
      right. It was the same old lady I had met in Russell Square, walking in
      front of James Hetheridge. Her withered lips went moving as if they would
      have uttered words had the breath been commissioned thither; her brow was
      contracted over her thin nose; and once and again her shining forefinger
      went up to her temple as if she were pondering some deep problem of
      humanity. How long I stood gazing at her I do not know, but at last I
      withdrew to my bed, and left her struggling to solve that which she could
      never solve thus. It was the symbolic problem of her own life, and she had
      failed to read it. I remember nothing more. She may be sitting there
      still, solving at the insolvable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have felt no inclination, with the broad sun of the squire&rsquo;s
      face, the keen eyes of James, and the beauty of Laetitia before me at the
      breakfast table, to say a word about what I had seen, even if I had not
      been afraid of the doubt concerning my sanity which the story would
      certainly awaken. What with the memories of the night and the want of my
      spectacles, I passed a very dreary day, dreading the return of the night,
      for, cool as I had been in her presence, I could not regard the possible
      reappearance of the ghost with equanimity. But when the night did come, I
      slept soundly till the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day, not being able to read with comfort, I went wandering about
      the place, and at length began to fit the outside and inside of the house
      together. It was a large and rambling edifice, parts of it very old, parts
      comparatively modern. I first found my own window, which looked out of the
      back. Below this window, on one side, there was a door. I wondered whither
      it led, but found it locked. At the moment James approached from the
      stables. &lsquo;Where does this door lead?&rsquo; I asked him. &lsquo;I will get the key,&rsquo; 
      he answered. &lsquo;It is rather a queer old place. We used to like it when we
      were children.&rsquo; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a stair, you see,&rsquo; he said, as he threw the door
      open. &lsquo;It leads up over the kitchen.&rsquo; I followed him up the stair.
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a door into your room,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s always locked now.&mdash;And
      here&rsquo;s Grannie&rsquo;s room, as they call it, though why, I have not the least
      idea,&rsquo; he added, as he pushed open the door of an old-fashioned parlour,
      smelling very musty. A few old books lay on a side table. A china bowl
      stood beside them, with some shrivelled, scentless rose-leaves in the
      bottom of it. The cloth that covered the table was riddled by moths, and
      the spider-legged chairs were covered with dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A conviction seized me that the old bureau must have belonged to this
      room, and I soon found the place where I judged it must have stood. But
      the same moment I caught sight of a portrait on the wall above the spot I
      had fixed upon. &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; I cried, involuntarily, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the very old
      lady I met in Russell Square!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said James. &lsquo;Old-fashioned ladies are like babies&mdash;they
      all look the same. That&rsquo;s a very old portrait.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So I see,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;It is like a Zucchero.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whose it is,&rdquo; he answered hurriedly, and I thought he
      looked a little queer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is she one of the family?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;They say so; but who or what she was, I don&rsquo;t know. You must ask Letty,&rdquo;
       he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The more I look at it,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the more I am convinced it is the same
      old lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he returned with a laugh, &lsquo;my old nurse used to say she was
      rather restless. But it&rsquo;s all nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That bureau in my room looks about the same date as this furniture,&rsquo; I
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It used to stand just there,&rsquo; he answered, pointing to the space under
      the picture. &lsquo;Well I remember with what awe we used to regard it; for they
      said the old lady kept her accounts at it still. We never dared touch the
      bundles of yellow papers in the pigeon-holes. I remember thinking Letty a
      very heroine once when she touched one of them with the tip of her
      forefinger. She had got yet more courageous by the time she had it moved
      into her own room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then that is your sister&rsquo;s room I am occupying?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am ashamed of keeping her out of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! she&rsquo;ll do well enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If I were she though,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;I would send that bureau back to its
      own place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What do you mean, Heywood? Do you believe every old wife&rsquo;s tale that
      ever was told?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She may get a fright some day&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He smiled with such an evident mixture of pity and contempt that for the
      moment I almost disliked him; and feeling certain that Laetitia would
      receive any such hint in a somewhat similar manner, I did not feel
      inclined to offer her any advice with regard to the bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little occurred during the rest of my visit worthy of remark. Somehow or
      other I did not make much progress with Laetitia. I believe I had begun to
      see into her character a little, and therefore did not get deeper in love
      as the days went on. I know I became less absorbed in her society,
      although I was still anxious to make myself agreeable to her&mdash;or
      perhaps, more properly, to give her a favourable impression of me. I do
      not know whether she perceived any difference in my behaviour, but I
      remember that I began again to remark the pinched look of her nose, and to
      be a little annoyed with her for always putting aside my book. At the same
      time, I daresay I was provoking, for I never was given to tidiness myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At length Christmas Day arrived. After breakfast, the squire, James, and
      the two girls arranged to walk to church. Laetitia was not in the room at
      the moment. I excused myself on the ground of a headache, for I had had a
      bad night. When they left, I went up to my room, threw myself on the bed,
      and was soon fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long I slept I do not know, but I woke again with that indescribable
      yet well-known sense of not being alone. The feeling was scarcely less
      terrible in the daylight than it had been in the darkness. With the same
      sudden effort as before, I sat up in the bed. There was the figure at the
      open bureau, in precisely the same position as on the former occasion. But
      I could not see it so distinctly. I rose as gently as I could, and
      approached it, after the first physical terror. I am not a coward. Just as
      I got near enough to see the account book open on the folding cover of the
      bureau, she started up, and, turning, revealed the face of Laetitia. She
      blushed crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Heywood,&rsquo; she said in great confusion; &lsquo;I thought
      you had gone to church with the rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I had lain down with a headache, and gone to sleep,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;But,&mdash;forgive
      me, Miss Hetheridge,&rsquo; I added, for my mind was full of the dreadful
      coincidence,&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t you think you would have been better at church
      than balancing your accounts on Christmas Day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The better day the better deed,&rsquo; she said, with a somewhat offended air,
      and turned to walk from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Excuse me, Laetitia,&rsquo; I resumed, very seriously, &lsquo;but I want to tell you
      something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looked conscious. It never crossed me, that perhaps she fancied I was
      going to make a confession. Far other things were then in my mind. For I
      thought how awful it was, if she too, like the ancestral ghost, should
      have to do an age-long penance of haunting that bureau and those horrid
      figures, and I had suddenly resolved to tell her the whole story. She
      listened with varying complexion and face half turned aside. When I had
      ended, which I fear I did with something of a personal appeal, she lifted
      her head and looked me in the face, with just a slight curl on her thin
      lip, and answered me. &lsquo;If I had wanted a sermon, Mr. Heywood, I should
      have gone to church for it. As for the ghost, I am sorry for you.&rsquo; So
      saying she walked out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest of the day I did not find very merry. I pleaded my headache as
      an excuse for going to bed early. How I hated the room now! Next morning,
      immediately after breakfast, I took my leave of Lewton Grange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And lost a good wife, perhaps, for the sake of a ghost, uncle!&rdquo; said
      Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I lost a wife at all, it was a stingy one. I should have been ashamed
      of her all my life long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than a spendthrift,&rdquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; returned her uncle. &ldquo;All the difference I see is,
      that the extravagant ruins the rich, and the stingy robs the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps she repented, uncle,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she did, Katey. Look here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Cornelius drew from the breast pocket of his coat a black-edged
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have kept up my friendship with her brother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All he knows
      about the matter is, that either we had a quarrel, or she refused me;&mdash;he
      is not sure which. I must say for Laetitia, that she was no tattler. Well,
      here&rsquo;s a letter I had from James this very morning. I will read it to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;MY DEAR MR. HEYWOOD,&mdash;We have had a terrible \shock this morning.
      Letty did not come down to breakfast, and Lizzie went to see if she was
      ill. We heard her scream, and, rushing up, there was poor Letty, sitting
      at the old bureau, quite dead. She had fallen forward on the desk, and her
      housekeeping-book was crumpled up under her. She had been so all night
      long, we suppose, for she was not undressed, and was quite cold. The
      doctors say it was disease of the heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Uncle Cornie, folding up the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the ghost had anything to do with it, uncle?&rdquo; asked Kate,
      almost under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know, my dear? Possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very sad,&rdquo; said Janet; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see the good of it all. If the
      ghost had come to tell that she had hidden away money in some secret place
      in the old bureau, one would see why she had been permitted to come back.
      But what was the good of those accounts after they were over and done
      with? I don&rsquo;t believe in the ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Janet, Janet! but those wretched accounts were not over and done
      with, you see. That is the misery of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Cornelius rose without another word, bade them good-night, and
      walked out into the wind.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
